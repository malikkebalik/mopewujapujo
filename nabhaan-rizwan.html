Shahnaz and Rizwan Siddiqui, his parents, were both Pakistani Muslims. They later moved to the United Kingdom. Both of his parents were artists as well.</p><p>In Pakistan, his father was a playwright. However, after relocating to the United Kingdom, he worked as an accountant and interpreter. His mother was a famous actress. She had also appeared as a child actor in her father’s films.</p><p>She also performed in plays written by Nabhaan’s father. In fact, Nabhaan’s father met his mother for the first time during the auditions for his plays.</p><p>Furthermore, Rizwan’s grandfather, Ahmed Ghazi, was a Pakistani filmmaker. Moreover, his grandfather fought on the British side during the First World War.</p><p>Mawaan, Nabhaan’s older brother, was also an artist. Mawaan was a comedian who appeared on Channel 4’s Taskmaster. Nabhan’s brother had a YouTube channel with over 88k subscribers as well.</p><p>Nabhaan grew up in a Muslim family and followed only a few of the religion’s rules. He was not, however, a practicing Muslim.</p><h2><span id=Height_Weight_and_Distinctive_Characteristics>Height, Weight, and Distinctive Characteristics</span></h2><p><strong>Nabhaan Rizwan is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs less than 78 kilograms.</strong></p><p>When it comes to Nabhaan’s distinguishing features, a particularly prestigious British media outlet described him as having “soft brown eyes, gunslinger cheekbones, and a particularly imperious coat.”</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun SCXW176941033 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW176941033 BCX8" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span></span></h2><p>Nabhaan had a decent social media following, not as large as some of his fellow young stars, but also not as obscure.</p><p>He had 7360 followers on Instagram, where he was the most popular. On Twitter, he was relatively insignificant, with only about 3k followers.</p><h2><span id=Nabhaan_Rizwan_Professional_Life_Career><span class="TextRun SCXW71661942 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW71661942 BCX8">Nabhaan Rizwan: Professional Life, Career</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW71661942 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Nabhan’s ascension to stardom was meteoric. He was a cricket-loving non-artist in a family of artists in his late teens (18/19). He was already a rising star in his early twenties, having worked for big names in British cinema like Sam Medes and Riz Ahmed.</p><p>Things changed when Nabhaan was approaching his twenties and his cricketing ambitions were fading. He had no desire to attend university. And, of course, his mother was always encouraging him to pursue a career in acting.</p><p>So he figured, what the hell. He didn’t really, but he did put on an acting show with some friends. Soon after, he was noticed by an agent. And after his first audition, he was cast as Raza Shar in BBC‘s BAFTA-nominated drama Informer.</p><p>Well, the road was clear. Following that, Nabhaan appeared on Channel 4’s drama series The Accident. Then there were streaks of big films directed by big-name directors.</p><p>Nabhaan first appeared in Sam Mendes’ Oscar-nominated British war drama, 1917. Then there was Mogul Mowgli, a drama film directed by Riz Ahmed that premiered at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival. Finally, there was Industry, HBO’s ambition-fueled, sex-filled, cocaine-fueled, decadent, indecent, irreverent, The Wolf of Wall Street-want tobe corporate drama.</p><p>Nabhaan was also working on a few projects. Grey Suits Us, a short film, and The Last Letter from Your Lover, a feature film, were both set to be released soon. Hiro Murai’s miniseries Station Eleven, on the other hand, was still in production. The show was about a flu pandemic that kills the vast majority of the world’s population. The filming of the show was, ironically, halted by a real pandemic.</p><p>Aside from acting, Nabhaan is a Hip-Hop artist who goes by the stage name El Huxley. Fantastic Planet, his first EP, was released in 2020. He does, after all, want to study fashion at Central Saint Martins.</p><h2><span id=Howmuch_Nabhaan_Rizwan_earn><span class="TextRun SCXW155343141 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW155343141 BCX8">How&nbsp;</span></span><span class="TextRun SCXW155343141 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW155343141 BCX8">much</span></span><span class="TextRun SCXW155343141 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW155343141 BCX8"> Nabhaan Rizwan earn?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW155343141 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"134233279":true,"201341983":0,"335559685":720,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Nabhaan Rizwan’s net worth was more than $500 thousand as of November 2020.

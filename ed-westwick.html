He is of British ancestry.</p><p>Peter and Carole Westwick were his parents when he was born.</p><p>Ed’s father is an educational psychologist, and his mother is a university lecturer.

At the age of six, he enrolled in a drama school, and after college, he joined the National Youth Theatre in London.</p><p>He also stands at a height of 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 meters). In terms of his weight, Ed was chastised in 2009 for his rapid weight gain during the third season of Gossip Girl, which forced the production to purchase an entirely new wardrobe for him. He did, however, regain his fitness after a brief period of miraculous weight loss.</p><h2>Wife or Dating of Ed Westwick</h2><p>Needless to say, the ladies man has had his fair share of love affairs and relationships.</p><p>Ed began dating Jessica Szohr, his Gossip Girl co-star, in 2008. They were a match made in heaven. Unfortunately, after four years of being together in an on-again, off-again relationship, they had to part ways.</p><h4>More on Jessica Szohr: Jessica Szohr’s Boyfriend, Ethnicity, and Dating</h4><p>Prior to his relationship with Jessica, Ed had a fling with Drew Barrymore in 2008. At a concert, the two were photographed kissing.</p><p>Ed stayed out of the dating scene for a while after his breakup with Jessica and kept a low profile. However, Ed and his girlfriend, Jessica Serfaty, re-entered the dating scene in 2017. They were even rumored to be planning a wedding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/celebrity/Ed-Westwick-Jessica-Serfaty2.JPG><p>However, things changed in November 2017, when Ed was accused of sexual assault by two women. Despite the fact that the accusations were unfounded, Ed was chastised as a result of the incident.</p><p>Jessica stood by Ed’s side even when he was in the midst of a crisis. The couple’s union, however, did not last forever, as they mutually parted ways in September 2018.</p><h4>After Divorce, Jessica Serfaty is Accused by Her Husband! Is There Really an Abandoned Son?</h4><p>Apart from his relationships with attractive women, Ed has also been accused of being gay due to his close friendship with Chace Crawford.

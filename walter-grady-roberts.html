Walter married Betty Lou Bredemus, an actress and acting coach whom he met while playing for the armed forces in the play “George Washington Slept Here.” They bonded fast and were great friends. When they embarked on a number of theater tours, they grew closer and married in 1955. They co-founded the wildly successful Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop. They formerly ran a children’s acting school and produced 15 episodes of Bum Bum and His Buddies, a children’s show on a local network.</p><h2><span id=The_Reason_behind_their_Separation>The Reason behind their Separation</span></h2><p>The couple was having financial problems, and the workshop they co-founded was slowly closing down. After nearly two decades of marriage, the couple decided to split. His wife filed for divorce in 1971, and it was finalized in 1972. However, the reason behind their split is unknown. Betty moved to Smyrna, Georgia, with her children in tow. Julia’s parents split when she was five years old.</p><h2><span id=Children8217s_Early_Exposure_to_the_Theater>Children’s Early Exposure to the Theater</span></h2><p>Walter was a three-parent family. Despite the fact that he died before seeing his children’s successful careers, he left an indelible effect on them to follow in his footsteps. Eric Roberts, his older son, was born in 1956 and has over 596 credits as an actor in the United States (one of the few actors to have more than 500 credits). His second child, Lisa, was born in 1965 and is also an actress and producer. Both are best known for being the brother and sister of Julia, a well-known Hollywood actress who was born in 1967.</p><h2><span id=Remarried_his_Ex-Wife>Remarried his Ex-Wife</span></h2><p>Betty, his ex-wife, married Michael Motes again in 1972, the same year they divorced. Nancy, their daughter, was born to them and died by suicide when she was 37 years old. Julia and her siblings had a terrible upbringing due to Michael’s violent behavior as a spouse and stepfather to his stepchildren. Betty filed for divorce from her abusive husband in 1983, citing cruelty as a reason.</p><h2><span id=Cancer_claimed_the_lives_of_both_Walter_and_Betty>Cancer claimed the lives of both Walter and Betty</span></h2><p>Regardless of the year, Walter and Betty both died as a result of their cancer battle. Walter died of throat cancer at the age of 44. In 1977, he went away. Betty, on the other hand, died in 2015 at the age of 80 from lung cancer. Despite not being able to spend much time with him, Julia misses him around her children Henry Daniel Moder and Hazel Moder. She considers herself betrayed because she does not have him as a grandfather. Her mother’s death had left her heartbroken. Her mother, she maintains, worked full-time while raising her children and showed no symptoms of being stressed.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity Parent</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Kim Munn</a></h3>Kim Munn estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

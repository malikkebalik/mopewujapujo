ピチカートファイヴのイメージが強いですが、
下積み時代の当時はOLもしていたそうです。
お金がなくても音楽とファッションがあれば幸せだったようですが、
当時からのファッションのへの考え方がすごいのです。
トレンドや男ウケを全く無視し、
モテなくて良いと開き直っていたそうです。
おそらく、男性目線を無視したことで、
今までの野宮真貴の個性があったのでしょう！
また子供の育児を楽しんでいたのも、
良い点だったようです。
歳を重ねて目が悪くなったとき、
老眼を恥ずかしいものではなくて、
おしゃれアイテムだと思っていたそうです。
そうそう、オフィスに伺いました（笑）。年齢を重ねることをネガティブに考えていくと、寂しくなっちゃうじゃないですか。でも、デザインが可愛ければ、老眼鏡だっておしゃれアイテム。年を取ったからこそ身につけられるモノってあるんですよ。そうすると、年齢を重ねるのも悪くないかなって思えますよね。引用元：https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20171202-00010001-bfj-ent&amp;amp;p=3
歳をとっているからこそ身につけられるもの、
そういう考え方が若いうちからあったのかすごいですね、
普通の女性は若さへの執着にこだわりますから。
若さが全てではなくて、
歳を重ねたからこその「今」を、
野宮真貴さんは効率的に大切にしているのです。
野宮真貴さんがプロデュースした老眼は、
芸術そのもので、もはや若い女性が嫉妬するレベルです。
その年齢に合ったファッションを、
掘り下げていく時代がいつか来ると思っていましたが、
それを始めるのは野宮真貴さんのようなデザイナーなのかもしれません。
野宮真貴の旦那・昼間徹史と息子の名前と大学(画像・動画) 野宮真貴さんといえば、
１９９６年に音楽プロデューサーの昼間さんと結婚されました。（当時はフジ局員）
同じ年に息子を出産し、
野宮真貴さんは育児に励んでました。
息子さんはその後に大学の医学部に進学したようですが、
かなり勉強を頑張れたそうです。
育児に関する苦労話も多くされますが、
それだけ愛情を持った育てた成果があったようです。
ちなみに息子さんの名前も顔も非公開ですが、
医者としての将来を考えたら、
メディア的には面白く、報道されるかもしれません。
また、通っていた大学はどこなのか不明ですが、
個人的には良い大学なのかな？と予想しています。
野宮真貴さんはバンドマンとしてだけでなく、
女性としての幸せも求めて、
バンドが一番忙しい時期に結婚し、子供を出産されました。
頭の中のバランスまでもがおしゃれに見えて、
個人的には羨ましいです。</description></item><item><title>Althea Grace</title><link>/althea-grace.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/althea-grace.html</guid><description>Althea Grace- Biography Althea Grace is a Chicago-based singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who is young and gifted.

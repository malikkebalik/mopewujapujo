Most of his previous hairstyles during his career in the music scene have mostly included variations of braided red hair. Although, the new look may not be so surprising to his hardcore fans as he is known for his edgy and infectiously confident personality and admired for his experimental take on his hairstyles. Yachty's music is about being you and staying positive. As a result of such optimism, he's amassed adoring fans from all around the Internet.</p><p>His debut album, 'Teenage Emotions' (which released in 2017) covers a wide range of feelings. As a fervent opponent of what some critics may deem "true" hip-hop, the LP saw the red-haired rapper bringing joviality and lighthearted fun to a genre frequently known for being rough and aggressive. The generous 21-track LP featured a mishmash of values, ideas and life mantras.</p><p>Yachty's 2018 followup LP 'Lil Boat 2' took a different turn from his debut album which resulted in mixed reviews. The stray from the initial bubbly side then saw him rapping of his wealth and celebrity status and it didn't pay off. After its release, AllMusic said, "There's an abundance of low-wattage boasts about financial and libidinal surpluses, most of which could have been composed by a generator. Softer and more melodic cuts are indicated with all-lowercase track titles. ... If Yachty can find a way to be his goofy self and elevate his writing, he can rebound."</p><p>Similar lukewarm reception from critics also happened with his latest album 'Lil Boat 3'. but RapReviews praised the album, stating, "Lil Boat 3 finds Yachty syncopating and stretching beyond his naturally baritone voice. He sounds more self-aware than ever, channeling his beloved infectious energy as the main driver for the album, rather than his erratic lyrical ability."</p><p>Yachty's fifth record 'End of the Summer' is slated for a release sometime this month, so perhaps his new look comes as a simultaneous effort to release something fresh and interesting this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopJmherqtwqGrsmWemsRurdSnq6KdXZ2uqr7SrbClnV2rtrOty2aroqNdqbysedWim56nXZm8rq3Ip5ZvZZaWu26%2BxJqaraGfo8Busc2dZKieXajCrrnEqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-franklin.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>John Franklin</span></a>

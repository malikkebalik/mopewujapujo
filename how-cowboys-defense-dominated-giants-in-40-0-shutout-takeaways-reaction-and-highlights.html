I mean what do you expect, losing by 40 points?”</p><p>The collapse of the offensive line became the focal point in a game that was initially billed as one that would demonstrate the progress the Giants had made in closing the gap to their division rival, who had beaten the Giants twice last year. In particular, Neal was under the microscope with the idea that his offseason spent making necessary changes to his game would lead to better results against a Cowboys front that embarrassed him last season. Instead, over the course of four rainy, miserable quarters, the Cowboys made it abundantly clear the gap between the two teams had, if anything, grown larger. As for Neal, well, all the hard work he put in this offseason didn’t seem to help very much.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57y6KtnmWSobyov46cprCan67AbsLSZp6imZ6pwG6%2FzZ9kpaGmmnq0r86rnGatoJmutbHSZp6apZViwLa5zJqpsmeDo8J6fsFyaX%2BmiJ58</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gloria-de-paula-wife-is-she-married-to-mayra-bueno-silva.html><span>←</span><span>Gloria De Paula Wife: Is She Married To Mayra Bueno Silva?</span></a>

The two talked about realizing their gender orientations and coming out.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Emily Hampshire’s Deal Breaker</h2><p>About 34 minutes into their conversation, the actress made a startling revelation about the ‘Skyscraper’&nbsp;singer. She revealed that Lovato slid into her DMs and asked her out on a date. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>You said, “Hey girl, I like you on the show. We should kick it sometime.” And then, below it, you said, “And by kick it, I mean go on a date. I find you attractive, or whatever.”&nbsp;</p><p>The actress, 40, then added that she appreciated Lovato, 29, being direct about asking her out on a date because she was confused about what “kick it” meant and was looking it up.</p><p>She then joked that the two of them had a decade age gap, which might be why she did not accept Lovato’s advances.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But then Lovato countered by reminding her of the couple&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Sarah Paulson</a> and Holland Taylor, who have a 32-year-age gap. Then realizing they&nbsp;might have accidentally compared Hampshire to Taylor, who was older by 38 years, Lovato&nbsp;tried to save themselves, noting that was not what they meant.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, Hampshire, who found the situation funny, took it in stride and agreed she was proud to be Taylor. The two, of course, did not start a romance, but it appears to be the&nbsp;start of a beautiful friendship.&nbsp;</p><h2>Emily Hampshire’s Coming Out</h2><p>During the podcast, Hampshire also revealed how she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">learned about her identity</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;Schitt’s Creek.&nbsp;Since its debut in 2015, the series has been&nbsp;widely&nbsp;celebrated for promoting LGBTQ acceptance.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>But the portrayal of Dan Levy’s David, who is attracted to anyone regardless of their gender identity, has been lauded by viewers and critics alike.&nbsp;During her revelation, Hampshire shared: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>From the beginning, Dan was like, “There will be no homophobia on Schitt’s Creek. It just doesn’t exist there.”&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Hampshire revealed that the show’s famous wine scene in which David explained&nbsp;to Stevie (Hampshire) his gender orientation while discussing wine actually helped her figure out her own identity.</p><p>For someone well-versed in LGBTQ+ stuff, she was surprised to learn about David’s orientation.&nbsp;</p><p>This new knowledge made her rethink her own identity, and it took her almost 5 years to decide what her identity was. At the time, she was dating someone, and there were message boards where people were questioning if she was lesbian. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This prompted her to ask Levy what her identity was, but she mentioned she did not care about where someone was on the gender spectrum as&nbsp;she just fell in love with a person.</p><p>That’s when Levy replied that she was omni-gendered.&nbsp;Hampshire thus knew from then on her gender orientation.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyVorZuuM6vmK2nXZq6qrjYZp%2BapaCotaq%2BxGabmqyZo7RvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danielle-busby-net-worth-age-weight-bio-wiki-kids-spouse.html><span>←</span><span>Danielle Busby Net worth, Age: Weight, Bio-Wiki, Kids, Spouse</span></a>

In fact, the more you give, the more you receive. Empowering women doesn't come from selfishness but rather from selflessness.”</p><p class=Zg>The second is from Dr. Phil McGraw, which <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://popculture.com/reality-tv/2019/05/27/sister-wives-kody-brown-seemingly-snipes-wife-meri-selfish-women-message>reads</a> that “not one bit of my self-esteem is tied up in your acceptance.”</p><p class=Zg>A few days later, the family’s patriarch <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/realkodybrown/status/1131959244981301248>tweeted</a>: “Bitterness is the undoing of creativity.

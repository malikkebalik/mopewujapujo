She is of Finnish, Irish, and Cantonese descent. Meg is a novelist and actress, renowned for her role in the film “Agnes of God,” which earned her an Academy Award nomination and a Golden Globe Award. Her accomplishments have contributed to her current net worth.</p><p>Meg Tilly’s net worth is $3 million. She has earned the majority of her wealth through success in both writing and acting. Meg is the author of six novels, including the Sheila A. Egoff Children’s Literature Prize finalist, “Porcupine.” It is anticipated that her wealth will continue to grow as she advances in her career.</p><h3>Meg Tilly’s Net Worth: $3 million</h3><p>Tilly attended Esquimalt High School in British Columbia and later pursued a career in dance in the United States after receiving a scholarship in New York City. She made her debut in the musical drama “Fame” in 1980 but had to halt her dance career due to a back injury.</p><p>Following this, she shifted her focus to acting and made her debut in the drama “The Trouble with Grandpa” in 1981. She then appeared in the second season of “Hill Street Blues” before landing her first starring role in “Tex,” alongside Matt Dillon. In 1983, she continued to gain prominence with the films “Psycho II” and “The Big Chill,” both of which received numerous Academy Award nominations and significantly boosted her net worth.</p><p>In 1985, Tilly’s role in “Agnes of God” earned her a Golden Globe Award. Throughout the late 1980s, she appeared in “Valmont” and “The Two Jakes.” In 1993, she starred in the horror film “Body Snatchers,” but paused her acting career for the next 15 years after sustaining a soccer-related injury. She made a comeback in 2010 with an episode of “Caprica” and contributed to the six-part series “Bomb Girls,” which garnered her several awards.</p><p>In addition to her acting career, Tilly began publishing novels, starting with “Singing Songs” in 1994. Her second novel, “Gemma,” was released 12 years later and addressed the disturbing topic of child abduction and abuse. In 2007, her novel “Porcupine” received numerous accolades for its portrayal of a girl’s life-altering experience when her father died in friendly fire in Afghanistan. Subsequent novels and their success have significantly increased her net worth. Meg’s most recent work is the novel “Behind the Scenes,” published in 2014.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, Meg has been married several times and currently resides in Toronto with her husband, author Don Calame.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><p><br><br></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiknp9dqbatuNisZLCdkaHBqXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marco-benevento.html><span>←</span><span>Marco Benevento</span></a>

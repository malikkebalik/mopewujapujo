Auguste Dupin (Carl Lumbly) his sad and strange tale, as flashbacks chronicle his childhood, starting in the 1950s.&nbsp;</p><p>These jumps to the past ultimately clue us in on how he rose to power, how his kids died as young adults, and why an investigator has 72 charges against Roderick in the present day – including a charge of defrauding the U.S. government.&nbsp;</p><p>Because this is a Flannagan show, soon it spirals into supernatural territory, with the “ghosts of the past” and “personal demons” becoming literal.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Mark Hamill as the shady family lawyer. <span class=credit>©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>Although the present day is rooted in the modern era, the story is brimming with Poe references, with character names like Lenore and Annabell Lee, and plot elements mined from stories such as “The Tell Tale Heart” and “The Masque of the Red Death.” At times, there’s even lines from his poems said aloud.&nbsp;</p><p>Some viewers might find the parts about the opioid crisis to be a little too “ripped from the headlines.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The Usher family in court: Bruce Greenwood, Kyliegh Curran, Ruth Codd, Crystal Balint, Matt Biedel, Mary McDonnell, Henry Thomas, Igby Rigney, Samantha Sloyan, Aya Furukawa, T’Nia Miller, Mark Hamill, Rahul Kohli, Kate Siegel and Sauriyan Sapkota. <span class=credit>©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>“The Fall of the House of Usher” also has less complexity than “The Haunting of Hill House,” since these characters are more overtly repugnant.</p><p>But, that makes it fun to watch them meet their ends in elaborate ways — at times with startling artistic gruesomeness that brings to mind NBC’s “Hannibal.” (It’s also cathartic, since the Usher family’s apparent real-life counterpart has faced few consequences for their alleged link to the opioid crisis).&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Carl Lumbly, Nicholas Lea, and Mark Hamill go over the strange tale of the Usher family. <span class=credit>©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>Additionally, the characters still do have some psychological depth, as the story digs into paranoia, guilt, and Roderick’s adult kids’ desire for his elusive approval.</p><p>The mystery isn’t who dies, but how and why it happens.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Bruce Greenwood as troubled patriarch Roderick Usher, reflecting on how his 6 adult kids died. <span class=credit>©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>Like most of Flanagan’s work, even when the show gets messy, it’s thoughtful horror with a lot on its mind. It demonstrates that the genre can be a lot more than gore and jump-scares.&nbsp;</p><p>But, there’s plenty of that stuff to be found here, too.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmamtforassYyfo5qmkZyur7%2BMrZ%2BeZZaWua15zp9kraCVYrWwwdKeZKieXarAqbHRZqmerpmaxHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leslie-fhima-has-been-hospitalized-on-her-65th-birthday-see-details-inside.html><span>←</span><span>Leslie Fhima has been hospitalized on her 65th birthday!

Initially, Verity's unidentified brother had called 911 to conduct a wellness check at their Jenkintown home on Tuesday, January 17. After police entered the home they were shocked to find decomposing body of victim Ried “wrapped in a white sheet and comforter,” reported <a href=# rel=nofollow>New York Post</a>. “They were also unfortunately able to see that there was evidence of Miriam in the house also, and she was deceased,” Steele said.</p><p>An autopsy report revealed the couple was shot in the head from a close range. “We hope and pray that that happened first,” Steele said. The Pennsylvania woman allegedly used a chainsaw on her parents and place their dismembered bodies in trash bags before disposing of them in two different trash cans. “There were signs of extreme trauma, and I’ll tell you that the chainsaw was found. And both Reid and Miriam were found in different stages of dismemberment.”</p><p>Steele did not share details of the motive but noted they were evidence that Verity had tried to break into a safe in the home. Family members of the deceased claimed they had not heard from the pair since January 7. It was later revealed Verity's brother had visited his parent's home when he noticed a body hidden beneath a blanket, according to a criminal complaint obtained by <a href=# rel=nofollow>ABC 6</a>.</p><p>Verity told him things had "been bad" at home, upon which he urged her to call the police but she told him she needed "more time." Subsequently, Verity's brother left the police and swiftly called 911. Verity was charged with first-degree murder and third-degree murder and is being held without bail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjK%2Bcq6GkrnqjscKkZKmdnqPAurjVmqWimV2svK6tzWaYq6qVqMGmsIyfpqtlm565rbXNoGShnaJivaK%2BxKerrGWRo7FuudStoKWZpJ67qHnToZyiql2XvKW1xKw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-tik-tok-user-chase-hudson-dating-know-his-girlfriend-and-his-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Tik Tok User, Chase Hudson Dating?

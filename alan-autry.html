Autry was a high school quarterback who earned a college scholarship and was drafted by the Green Bay Packers. He was quickly removed from the team and went to Hollywood to become an actor, starring in films and television. On the television series In the Heat of the Night, he played Captain “Bubba” Skinner. Autry was mayor of Fresno, California, from 2000 to 2008, and then returned to movies, acting, and producing.</p><h2><span id=Childhood>Childhood</span></h2><p>Carlos Alan Autry was born on July 31, 1952, in Shreveport, Louisiana. Soon after, his parents, Carl and Verna Brown Autry separated, and his mother changed his name to Carlos Brown and sent him to California to start a new life. When he was six years old, his mother married a migrant field worker named Joe Duty, and the family moved regularly to pick cotton, grapes, and apricots. Autry had attended six schools by the time he was in fourth grade. His family relocated to Riverdale, California, when he was 12 years old, where his father got consistent work as a tractor operator and his mother worked as a maid.</p><h2><span id=Football_Profession>Football Profession</span></h2><p>Autry was a standout quarterback for the Riverdale High School football team, and after graduating in 1970, he was awarded a scholarship to the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California. When the Green Bay Packers picked him as a backup quarterback in 1975, he had just finished with a Bachelor of Arts degree and was preparing to become a teacher. He appeared in three games during the 1976 season before being released by then-coach Bart Starr the following year. Leaving football behind, he tracked out a friend who had introduced him to film director Robert Altman and traveled to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting.</p><h2><span id=Career_as_an_Actor>Career as an Actor</span></h2><p>Remember My Name, directed by Robert Altman, starred Autry (then known as Carlos Brown) in a brief role in 1978. He married Vicky Brown in 1980, and they have one daughter, Lauren. Autry reconnected with his biological father, Carl, while working on the film Southern Comfort in Shreveport, Louisiana. Soon after, he reverted to his maiden name, Autry, and adopted his middle name, Alan, as his first name.</p><h2><span id=Megan_Thee_Stallion>Megan Thee Stallion</span></h2><p>Throughout the 1980s, Autry appeared as a guest star on a variety of television shows, including Cheers, The A-Team, Dukes of Hazzard, and Newhart. He also succumbed to Hollywood’s drug and alcohol temptations. His rare acting engagements and vices strained his marriage with Brown, and the couple separated in 1986. That same year, he became a Christian for the first time and began to change his life. He was cast as Sergeant “Bubba” Skinner in the television series In the Heat of the Night, which also starred Carroll O’Connor, in 1988. The show aired till 1995.</p><p>Autry married Kimberlee Green in 1994, and she had a daughter, Heather, from a previous marriage. The pair founded Dirt Road Productions in 1997, and in 2002, they created The Legend of Jake Kincaid, a television movie in which Alan functioned as producer, director, and scriptwriter, as well as starring with Green and son Austin.</p><h2><span id=Career_in_Politics>Career in Politics</span></h2><p>Autry was elected mayor of Fresno, California, as a Republican in November 2000. In 2004, he was re-elected with more than 72 percent of the vote. As mayor, he was able to keep a balanced budget with a surplus without having to slash municipal positions. He was a fervent supporter of California’s anti-gay marriage Proposition 8. In 2004, he oversaw an effort to eliminate homelessness in Fresno by ordering sweeps of homeless encampments in the city’s downtown. A federal court ruled that the program violated the 4th and 5th Amendment rights of homeless persons by destroying property without due process.</p><p>Although Autry first opposed the verdict, he eventually realized that Fresno’s homeless policy was discriminatory and publicly apologized to the homeless community. Autry worked with the Fresno City Council in the closing months of his final tenure as mayor to draught a 10-year strategy to combat chronic homelessness.</p><h2><span id=Years_Later>Years Later</span></h2><p>From 2008 to 2010, Autry had a radio talk show in Fresno after leaving office as mayor. He then focused his attention on his production company and actor’s workshop, producing the film Almost Home, in which Autry plays a homeless veteran.</p><a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Phoebe Gates</a></h3>Who is Phoebe Gates?

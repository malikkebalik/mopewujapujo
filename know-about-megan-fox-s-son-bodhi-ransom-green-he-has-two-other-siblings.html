His dad, Green is a well known American actor and producer, while mother Fox is one of the multi-talented actress and model all the time.</p><p>He was born on &nbsp;February 12, 2014, in the United States. Further, he has two siblings named<strong> </strong><a href=#>Noah Shannon Green</a> (born on September 27, 2012), and<strong> </strong><a href=#>Journey River Green</a> (born in August 2016). Bodhi is the grandchild of Franklin Thomas Fox<strong>, </strong><a href=#>Gloria Darlene Fox</a><strong>, George Green, </strong>and<strong> Joyce Green</strong>.</p><h2>His Dad and Mom Got Hitched in 2010</h2><p>Megan, 34, and Brian, 46, first met on the set of the ABC sitcom <i>Hope & Faith</i> in 2004. However, because of the age gap, Austin Green was initially hesitant to start a relationship, as he was 30, and she was just 18.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/5/24/e55319ffee52b5aa11ba95caa50ddaaf-1590324351299.jpg><p>But the lovebirds began dating after a few talks and dates and declared their engagement in November 2006. And their relationship ended in February 2009, but somehow they re-engaged on June 1, 2010.</p><p>On June 24, 2010, Fox and her partner were married in an intimate, sunset ceremony on Hawaii beach. The private wedding function was held at Historic Ka'upulehu at Four Seasons Resort. <strong>Kassius</strong>, 18, whose mother is Green 's ex, <strong>Vanessa Marcil</strong>, was only witnessed during the day.</p><h2>Have Megan and Brian Again Separated?</h2><p>Yes, it's going to over for TV stars, Fox and Green. But this is not their first time discussing the idea of divorce. As they already filed the divorce after three years of marriage citing irreconcilable differences in August 2015. But, in 2016, they reconciled.</p><p>Now, once again after having remained together for 11 years, it has been announced that the long-term married couple has planned to go separately. Brian stated on his new podcast episode With Brian Austin Green: “Since the end of the year, we’ve really been trying to be apart and figure out what life is now. It’s a big change for both of us."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/5/24/megan-fox-brian-austin-green-kids-1590326443828.jpg><p>The Beverly Hills, 90210 even discussed the split after <a href=# rel=nofollow>rumors </a>of his estranged wife and the romance of <strong>Machine Gun Kelly </strong>went viral. He claims also he's not even upset by her meeting or spending time with MGK.</p><p>The online sources claimed that the two had been living in different homes for several months before the coronavirus outbreak. Now <strong>Jake Johnson</strong>'s ex-Fox has been living in Calabasas and Brian is staying in Malibus as their three children continue to co-parent.</p><h2>The Total Amount Net Worth of Bodhi Ransom Green</h2><p>Bodhi&nbsp;who is just 6 years old is still young to start his own career and is known as a celebrity kid like <a href=#><strong>Ramone Malik Hill</strong></a>. Thus, for now, he's enjoying her parent's assets being the son of millionaires. When it comes to his parents' net worth, Brian and Fox shared the combined net worth of<strong> $10 million</strong>. They made this heavy fortune throughout their own work as an actor and actress.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, his mom, Fox, the 163 cm tall, also makes an extra amount from her modeling career as she endorsed by many brands like Sharper Image,&nbsp;Armani,&nbsp;Acer. She is signed with ICM Partners, and United Talent Agency.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/5/24/download%20(1)-1590328369084.jpg><p>In addition to that, Megan and Brian sold their Los Feliz mansion for <strong>$3.75 million </strong>in 2014. They also offered one house in Los Angeles for <strong>$2.6 million</strong>, and another for <strong>$1.299 million</strong>.

Mariucci’s career started in 1978.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Steve Mariucci is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Mariucci’s net worth is as high as $16 million, an amount earned through his successful career as a coach. In addition to his coaching work in the NFL, Mariucci has also served as a television sportscaster, which has improved his wealth too.</p><h3>Steve Mariucci Net Worth $16 Million</h3><p>Steve Mariucci grew up in Michigan, where he went to Iron Mountain High and played football, basketball, and was on the track team. Steve later studied at Northern Michigan University and was a three-time All-America (Division II) quarterback, before going on to coach running backs at his alma mater in 1978.</p><p>From 1980 to 1982, Mariucci worked as the quarterbacks coach at Cal State Fullerton, and later trained wide receivers at Louisville (1983–1984). In 1985, Steve signed his first professional contract with the United States Football League’s Orlando Renegades, while the next year, he joined the USC as wide receivers and special teams coach. He continued to serve in the same position at California from 1987 to 1989, then in 1990, Steve became their offensive coordinator.</p><p>Mariucci’s first NFL experience came in 1992 when he joined the Green Bay Packers as quarterbacks coach, but after spending four seasons with the Packers, Steve returned to California State in 1996, where he got the job of the head coach. However, the following year, Mariucci was hired by the San Francisco 49ers to become their new head coach and went on to a 13-3 record in regular season, but after defeating the Minnesota Vikings, the 49ers lost to the Green Bay Packers in the National Football Conference.</p><p>In 1998, Mariucci led the 49ers to the 12-4 record and again reached the postseason, but lost to the eventual NFL champions the Atlanta Falcons, 18-20 in the divisional round. He failed to reach playoffs in 1999 and 2000, but returned in 2001 with a 12-4 season, when they lost to Green Bay Packers in a wild card game. Steve’s final year with the 49ers brought him another playoff appearance, but after eliminating the New York Giants in a memorable match, San Francisco was crushed 31-6 by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who become the Super Bowl champions.</p><p>In January 2003, the 49ers fired Mariucci, but after one month, he signed a contract with the Detroit Lions. Steve stayed with the Lions until 2005, but failed to reach the postseason in three seasons there, recording 5-11, 6-10, and 4-7 seasons, before being fired by the same General Manager who gave Mariucci $25 million for five years. His last game was the Thanksgiving Day loss to the Atlanta Falcons, 27-7. In his nine seasons as an NFL head coach, Mariucci has a 72-67 regular and 3-4 playoff record. He decided not to return to coaching but joined the NFL Network to work as an analyst on “NFL GameDay Morning”, and although he was linked with various jobs at college and pro levels, he hasn’t coach any team since.<br>Regarding his personal life, Steve Mariucci is married to Gayle; they have four children and currently resides in Monte Sereno, California.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.904530744337><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Steve Mariucci</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$16 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 4, 1955</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Iron Mountain, Michigan, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American football coach</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Northern Michigan University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Gayle Wood</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Stephen Mariucci, Tyler Mariucci, Adam Mariucci, Brielle Mariucci</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Dee Mariucci, Ray Mariucci</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Siblings</td><td>Bob Mariucci, Cheryl Hosking, Michael Mariucci, Sandy Mariucci, Donna Ayotte</td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/stevemariucci</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1205724/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Sports Emmy Award for Outstanding Sports Personality - Studio Analyst</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>TV Shows</td><td>Thursday Night Football, Nfl gameday final</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=7><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>Was fired by the Detroit Lions 11 games into the 2005 season after leading the Lions to a 4-7 overall record and falling out of contention for the NFC North division.

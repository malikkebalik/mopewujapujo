Bring the beat in!
Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can’t you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you’re near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Now everybody asks me why I’m smiling out from ear to ear
They say love hurts
But I know it’s gonna take a little work
Nothing’s perfect
But it’s worth it</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Husband, Siblings, Net Worth &amp;amp; Movie Ventures</h2><time>Sep 22, 2024</time>

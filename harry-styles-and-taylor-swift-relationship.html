The singer of “Blank Space” was reportedly seen having a great time dancing with Disney Channel megastar Selena Gomez while Harry and his former bandmates from One Direction sang their famous number one hit, “What Makes You Beautiful.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_did_Taylor_and_Harry_start_dating></span><strong>When did Taylor and Harry start dating?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A few months later, in December of the same year, the music stars made headlines again when they were seen out for a romantic stroll in Central Park together while bundled up in winter coats and even sporting similar dark blue trousers.</p><p>The singers flew to Harry’s house to celebrate Tay’s 23rd birthday after being seen out together on numerous occasions looking incredibly in love. The Golden singer allegedly introduced his Lover to mother Styles, and the group was even captured feeding the birds.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_long_have_Taylor_and_Harry_dated></span><strong>How long have Taylor and Harry dated?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On January 4, 2013, the it-couple left for a sun-drenched Caribbean vacation that seemed like the stuff of Wildest Dreams, but Taylor was sent home alone while Harry partied the night away on Richard Branson’s private island, where they were also spotted using the hot tub. This trip sparked rumours that the couple had hit a rough patch.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_did_Taylor_and_Harry_break_up></span><strong>When did Taylor and Harry break up?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Only a few days later, on January 7, it was revealed that the couple had broken up, much to the chagrin of their devoted “Haylor” shippers. The pair split up, according to The Mirror, following a spate of heated arguments. Additionally, it was said that Harry’s interest in other women was becoming a source of friction in their relationship; however, a spokesman for the author of Harry’s House refuted these claims.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Whether_they_dated_twice></span><strong>Whether they dated twice?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fans had hoped for the couple to get back together and sail off into the sunset, but alas, their brief romance was just that. The former pair was observed celebrating at the same table at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show afterparty on December 2, 2014, which led to rumours that their romance was rekindling.</p><p>One Direction released their song Perfect soon after the public appearance, leading fans to believe it was about Taylor. In the song, the line “And if you like cameras flashin’ every time we go out and if you’re looking for someone to write your breakup songs about, baby, I’m perfect” is included.</p><p>Even if the lyrics were written as a loving ode to the country singer, Harry said in an interview that he would never admit they were. I’m never going to tell someone what a song is about because I feel like it should be up to them, the speaker said.</p><p class=has-medium-font-size><strong>Also, Read</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtooJGnv7p50q2wpZ2jYq6vsIytmLKkn6d6tMPIn6tmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dem-minority-whip-katherine-clark-s-daughter-riley-dowell-busted-for-assaulting-boston-cop.html><span>←</span><span>Dem Minority Whip Katherine Clark's daughter Riley Dowell busted for assaulting Boston cop</span></a>

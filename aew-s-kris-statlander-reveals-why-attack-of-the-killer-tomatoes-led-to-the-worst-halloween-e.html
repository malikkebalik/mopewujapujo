Mostly just recovering from my knee surgery, getting stronger, and getting myself ready to get back in the ring,” Kris tells <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. Kris suffered a torn ACL during an August episode of AEW Dark when attempting to do a “big boot” move. It was an innocuous move that resulted in injury. In the wake of something similar happening to “Hangman” Adam Page – who suffered a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>concussion</a> during his World Title fight with <strong>Jon Moxley </strong>on the Oct. 18 episode of AEW Dynamite – it’s clear that those inside the ring are trained professionals, and the closest that fans should get to copying AEW wrestlers is by dressing up like them for Halloween.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>There should be plenty of Statlanders trick-or-treating this year. Though she has shed her alien persona for a more grounded grappler identity, young fans might paint their face the way Kris Statlander did to dress as her. It might be better than the costume the young Statlander had to wear one year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/George-Clooney-Return-of-the-Killer-Tomatoes-Ev-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>“In like, first or second grade, I was in dance, and we did a routine to a song called ‘Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes,'” Kris tells <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>, referring to the 1978 horror parody (and the 1978 sequel, Return of the Killer Tomatoes, which features a young <strong>George Clooney </strong>early on in his career.) “We were all dressed as giant tomatoes,” says Kris. “My mom forced me to reuse the costume by having my grandma see red beads onto it to make it a strawberry for Halloween. I told her I hated it, and I cried all day and it was the worst day of my life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Hopefully, Kris won’t feel so bad if <strong>HL </strong>includes the theme song to Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes along with her song selections for The Sound of Halloween.</p><h2>Krist Statlander’s Halloween Playlist Songs</h2><h3>Bakar, “Ghosts”</h3><span class=embed-youtube style=text-align:center;display:block></span><h3>Bakar, “Hell N Back”</h3><span class=embed-youtube style=text-align:center;display:block></span><h3>The Wallflowers, “One Headlight”</h3><span class=embed-youtube style=text-align:center;display:block></span><h3>Michael Jackson, “Thriller”</h3><span class=embed-youtube style=text-align:center;display:block></span><h3>Lewis Lee & Tom Coleman, “Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes”</h3><span class=embed-youtube style=text-align:center;display:block></span><p id=content-paragraph-7></p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>HollywoodLife: What do you think will be the most popular Halloween costume this year?

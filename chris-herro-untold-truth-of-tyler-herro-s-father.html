He grew up with a passion for basketball and played for West Allis Hale High School, where he was a star player. He received offers from Saint Louis and Florida State to play at the collegiate level, but his dreams were shattered when he suffered an ACL injury during his senior year. He lost his scholarship opportunities and had to give up his playing career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Family and Business</h2><p>Chris married Jennifer (Jenn) Herro in 1999. Jenn was also an athlete in college, playing volleyball for Wisconsin-Milwaukee. The couple settled in Greenfield, Wisconsin, and had three children: Tyler, Austin, and Myles. Chris became the owner of Superior Disposal, a waste management company. He also worked as a concrete contractor and a roofing specialist during the summer, and plowed snow during the winter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Influence on Tyler’s Basketball Development</h2><p>Chris never lost his love for basketball and passed it on to his son Tyler, who was born on January 20, 2000. Chris taught Tyler the basics of the game and coached him in youth leagues. He also encouraged Tyler to work hard and develop a strong work ethic. Chris was always there for Tyler, attending his games and practices, cheering him on, and giving him advice.</p><p>Chris also helped Tyler make some crucial decisions in his basketball journey. He backed Tyler when he decommitted from Wisconsin to play for Kentucky, a move that drew criticism from some fans. And he was proud of Tyler when he declared for the 2019 NBA draft after one season at Kentucky.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reaction to Tyler’s NBA Success</h2><p>Tyler was selected by the Miami Heat with the 13th pick in the 2019 NBA draft. He quickly became a fan favorite and a key contributor for the Heat, especially during their run to the 2020 NBA Finals in the Orlando bubble. Tyler averaged 16 points per game in the playoffs and set several records for a rookie, including scoring 37 points in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics.</p><p>Chris was ecstatic to see his son shine on the biggest stage. He watched every game from home with his family and friends, wearing Tyler’s jersey and celebrating every shot. He also traveled to Orlando to watch Tyler play in person for Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joy of Becoming a Grandfather</h2><p>In early 2021, Tyler found out that his girlfriend Katya Henry, an Instagram model, was pregnant with their first child. Tyler and Katya welcomed their daughter Zya Elsie Herro in September 2021. Chris was overjoyed to become a grandfather and embraced his new role with enthusiasm. In addition to Zya Chris has a grandson named Harlem Herro whom Tyler and Katya gave birth to on January 12, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGiaoaqZqHqpsdGrpmatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd507KjnqpdnbKzvs6sZJ%2BZpJ2ys3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chang-hye-jin.html><span>←</span><span>Chang Hye-jin</span></a>

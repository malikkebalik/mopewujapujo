The former Victoria’s Secret angel chose to have her long wavy hair down and also accessorized with earrings as she topped her look off with sparkly silver slip-on heels. The ladies appeared to even share a laugh at one point as Katy held a white card with her name on it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Orlando-Blooms-Fiance-Katy-Perry-Ex-Wife-Miranda-Kerr-ss-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Katy and Miranda’s latest appearance together comes almost 10 years after Miranda split from Orlando, with whom she shares 12-year-old son<strong> Flynn</strong>. Katy <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>started dating Orlando</a> in 2016, got engaged to him in 2019, and the couple now <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>share a two-year-old daughter <strong>Daisy</strong></a>. Both Katy and Miranda are known for being very supportive of one another and having a friendly relationship despite their separate romances with the Lord of the Rings star.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The successful beauties have both publicly complimented each other during memorable moments and their kindness for each other has been pretty inspirational to their fans. Shortly after Katy returned to work after giving birth in 2020, she shared a behind-the-scenes <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram photo</a> from her job at American Idol, and Miranda was quick <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>to respond</a> with encouraging and loving words. “Omg you’re amazing! Love you,” she wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Months before that, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Miranda also liked</a> Katy’s pregnancy announcement. A source previously told us that Orlando’s soon-to-be wife and ex have become great friends and after Daisy’s birth, Katy couldn’t wait to introduce her to Miranda. “As soon as she’s ready for visits Katy will welcome Miranda with open arms,” the source <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EXCLUSIVELY told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong></a> at the time. “She and Katy have a great relationship and are genuinely friends.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ye5FyZqiqnJa7pbuMm6Oop51is6qtzZycnmWblsG6ec%2BeqauxXZrFbrnIq5innJFiuKa%2B0Wapnq2ensGmecadmLJlpaiubq3RrWSgmZyWerG0zq2mrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./latto-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Latto Net Worth</span></a>

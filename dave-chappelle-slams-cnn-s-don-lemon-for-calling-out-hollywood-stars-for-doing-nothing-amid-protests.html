The comedian who chose to stay silent too <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tR6mKcBbT4">questioned</a> why a celebrity’s opinion is relevant in the situation.</p><p class=Zg>“Does it matter about celebrity? No. This is the streets talking for themselves, they don’t need me right now. I kept my mouth shut. And I’ll still keep my mouth shut.

He <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tR6mKcBbT4">posed</a>, “Why would anyone care what their favorite comedian thinks after they saw a police officer kneel on a man’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds?”</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>LEMON RESPONDS</strong></p><p class=Zg>He agreed that the young people who are out on the streets don’t care what the older generation thought and <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O-BInYNEyo">added</a>, “this is not a moment for modesty.”</p><p class=Zg>Lemon commended Chappelle, who he admits is his favorite comedian, for using his platform to speak out and even offered an invitation to the comedian to come on to his show.</p><p class=Zg>At the end of the day, Lemon pointed out, it didn’t matter that he and Chappelle agreed or disagreed in opinion because it ultimately attracts attention to the issues at hand.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>TWO A-LIST CELEBRITIES LEMON CALLED OUT</strong></p><p class=Zg>Like Lemon, many other celebrities have chosen to become more visible these days to lend their support to the Black Lives Matter cause.</p><p class=Zg>Among them were big-name stars, Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry who <a class="zd d" href=#>Lemon</a> also previously called out for doing nothing.

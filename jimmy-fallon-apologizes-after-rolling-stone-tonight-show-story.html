Jimmy Fallon is said to have offered an apology to “Tonight Show” staffers for his reported workplace behavior during a Thursday night video call. An attendee of the all-hands meeting characterized the funnyman’s mea culpa as “pretty earnest.” The news comes after Rolling Stone published a story in which 16 current and former employees accused the late night talk show host, 48, of being “erratic,” drunk at work and creating a “toxic work environment."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Chris prides himself on being available to the staff and a transparent leader. He’s exactly what the show needed.”</p><p>Fallon also apparently acknowledged the amount of turnover&nbsp;“The&nbsp;Tonight Show”&nbsp;has had in regard to its showrunners, but emphasized that Miller is “a great leader” and is there to stay.</p><p>“I want the show to be fun, [it] should be inclusive to everybody,” Fallon said, according to the employees. “It should be the best show.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Fallon pictured on the show on April 24. <span class=credit>Todd Owyoung/NBC via Getty Images</span></figure><p>In the follow-up story, Rolling Stone claimed that Miller sent out an email to employees to discuss the matter.</p><p>“I wanted to make you all aware of an online story that just hit on&nbsp;rollingstone.com&nbsp;that includes past allegations of inappropriate behavior at the show,” Miller allegedly wrote in the email.&nbsp;</p><p>“While I know the reporter reached out to many of you before the piece ran, I don’t believe what’s written is reflective of the overall culture of our extraordinary team that I’m so lucky and proud to work with every day. The place described in the article is not the place I know.</p><p>He apparently added, “Still, it’s disappointing to see something published that does not capture the positive and inclusive environment I believe we have created together.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Fallon reportedly called Rolling Stone’s story “embarrassing.” <span class=credit>Todd Owyoung/NBC via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Miller also allegedly “encouraged employees to raise any concerns they might have with him, their managers, or HR,” according to Rolling Stone.</p><p>NBC told The Post in a statement, “We are incredibly proud of&nbsp;‘The Tonight Show,’ and providing a respectful working environment is a top priority. As in any workplace, we have had employees raise issues; those have been investigated and action has been taken where appropriate. As is always the case, we encourage employees who feel they have experienced or observed behavior inconsistent with our policies to report their concerns so that we may address them accordingly.”</p><p>The Post&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has previously reported&nbsp;</a>about Fallon’s drinking and partying getting “out of hand” in 2015, and a bartender who served him commented, “He’s a mess.”&nbsp;</p><p>Page Six reported in October 2016 that top-ranking&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC execs had warned Fallon</a>&nbsp;to cut back on the alcohol in fear that “he was&nbsp;<a href=#>out of control</a>&nbsp;and something could happen while he’s out drinking.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Jimmy Fallon drinking on “The Tonight Show” with Taraji P.

I remember this moment quite well … I teased Jimmy about a flub, and we all had a fun laugh about how rarely Jimmy is thrown off. It was not uncomfortable at all. Jimmy and I still occasionally recall it and laugh. Idiotic twisting of events.”</p><p>A source with knowledge of “The Tonight Show” also told The Post on Thursday that Rolling Stone’s version of the Seinfeld story is inaccurate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3JmaW9fn7auudhmnZqknKS7bq3PqKOon5mvsrR5wJ%2Brnqpdp7ytuMinnmarpKS7pnnTqKWin5iperS0zrBkrKyfp8Zw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-joe-lombardi-fired-career-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Is Joe Lombardi Fired?

You know, he was constantly writing s***, he’s a dork and a nerd but he’s got a bit of wit behind a computer screen.</p><p>"Every single time that it was unscripted, improvised, he'd short-circuit, couldn't f****** keep it together.</p><p>"So, I was like, 'I not only need to run at him, but I need to have a change of speed because that's gonna make him go into his natural crotch-sniffing instincts. If I just change the speed on him, he's gonna f****** duck.'"</p><p>"That's why I came out slow, cut the little angle, and let him be like, 'Okay, we're gonna circle it up.' Soon as I change speed, what does he do? Goes to his initial instincts, he's a f****** crotch sniffer, go kiss the crotch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/09/NINTCHDBPICT000519742435.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/jorge-masvidal-knees-ben-askren-805299224.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in MMA</h2></p><p>"When I'm doing it the night before, I'm like, 95 per cent certain [it will land], because of the way he'd been acting all week. Like, all I got to do at any given moment is just get this guy uncomfortable.</p><p>"Go from like chill to invade his space whether it was the opening bell or in the second round or midway through the third. I just knew I had to invade his space and he's gonna go to his natural instincts.</p><p>"I know I keep saying it, but I just knew, the way he’d freeze up every time we talked, the way he walked, the way he got stiff – I just knew.”</p><p>Masvidal has won just one of his four fights since beating Askren and is currently on a three-fight losing streak after twice falling short against Kamaru Usman in title fights before being <a href=#>outpointed by Colby Covington</a>.</p><p>Despite that, the 38-year-old could find himself back in welterweight contention if he’s able to beat Burns next month due to his long-running rivalry with the current champion, Leon Edwards.</p><p>Masvidal <a href=#>clashed with ‘Rocky’ </a>backstage at UFC London in 2019 and the Englishman has been desperate to settle the score with him in the Octagon ever since.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraKWdlnxyf5ZrbW5wX5%2B8s7PEZqSaq6aesaK4jJ6vqaSRnru0ecmonGaqn5yur3nBnqVmmaOgv6a6jJ%2BjsqGenHqsusSeZKSnXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alejandro-salomon-s-wealth.html><span>←</span><span>Alejandro Salomons Wealth</span></a>

After getting a nose job in the past, it appears she's done it again after pictures of her at the 2018 BMI R&B and Hip-Hop Awards emerged online. While she looks almost unrecognizable with her new look, she looks gorgeous.</p><p class=Zg>There was something different about Leakes' face, but it is quite hard to distinguish what exactly she had done. Was it a facelift? A nose job? Some people are saying it could have easily been really good contouring by her makeup artist.</p><p class=Zg>Either way, NeNe looks beautiful, and she deserves to be happy with how she looks.</p><p class=Zg>The "Real Housewives of Atlanta" star has been quite busy taking care of her husband Gregg, who has been recovering from cancer. The couple has been making the most out of their time together, recently vacationing in the Bahamas as she shared on Instagram.</p><p class=Zg>While Gregg and NeNe seemed to enjoy themselves, one particular photo caused quite the uproar on social media, which stemmed because people couldn't seem to realize that she was being sarcastic.</p><p class=Zg>Just a couple of weeks after NeNe revealed that her husband was undergoing cancer treatment, they took a break from the city life to get some fresh air and quality time together.</p><p class=Zg>While the reality TV star shared adorable photos of both of them, one of her selfies were misinterpreted, and people thought she was transitioning to become a white woman.</p><p class=Zg>"Thank you @fabfacesmua for keeping me looking like a white woman whenever I’m in the Bahamas. I wish you much success #bahamamomma#thesepeoplecrazy #lovebeingabrowngirl#lifeofnene"</p><p class=Zg>It's quite clear that NeNe was being sarcastic, but people couldn't seem to understand that. Nonetheless, she has been focusing on what truly matters, which is her happiness and her family's as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpnbHFpa3qvsc2eZKWdkaCytHnSqZiro6Niva2t0q2gnGWjqr%2BosdGyZKyolZjCb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leeann-tweeden-net-worth-salary-earnings-facts-wiki-bio.html><span>←</span><span>LeeAnn Tweeden Net Worth, Salary, Earnings, Facts, Wiki-Bio</span></a>

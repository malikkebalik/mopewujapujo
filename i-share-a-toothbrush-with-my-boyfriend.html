Sarah Silverman has admitted she’s been sharing a toothbrush with her boyfriend Rory Albanese since they started dating back in late 2020.
The comedian, 51, confessed to the unsavory dental practice during an interview on “The View” Wednesday, declaring: “We’ve never&nbsp;not&nbsp;shared a toothbrush.”
The daytime hosts were left startled by the confession, with co-star Sunny Hostin, 53, saying she was “befuddled” by the behavior."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

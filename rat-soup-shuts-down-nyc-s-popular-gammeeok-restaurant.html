If there was a mouse that big, there’s no way I wouldn’t have missed it. There is also a video recording of the recording process. We checked the whole process of making the soup, but we couldn’t find any problems.”</p><p>On Monday, magazine editor Eunice Lucero-Lee <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a series of photos</a> and videos to Instagram of what appears to be a&nbsp;<a href=#>dead black rat</a>&nbsp;floating in the beef soup she said she and her husband, Jason Lee, had delivered Saturday from Gammeeok’s Manhattan location.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>According to a lawsuit filed by the couple and obtained by The Post, the pair became “violently sick, causing them to vomit and seek medical attention.”</p><p>The suit states the two “sustained severe, serious and permanent personal injuries.”</p><p>The Post contacted Lucero-Lee for comment Friday.</p><p>Prior to Gammeeok’s closure Wednesday, the health department gave the Manhattan location a “C” rating.</p><p>A Jan. 18 inspection revealed several alleged sanitary violations, including a food contact surface not properly washed, rinsed and sanitized after each use; and food, supplies and equipment not protected from a potential source of contamination.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmam9fp661edKorKllo53Ctb%2BMnaawpl2jxqS%2FjKmmqa2clr9us8CmpJ6dn6B6s7HSrZiuqpGjwXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./colbey-northcutt-bio-age-wiki-facts-and-family.html><span>←</span><span>Colbey Northcutt - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</span></a>

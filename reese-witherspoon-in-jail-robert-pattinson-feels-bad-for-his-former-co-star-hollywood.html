As her friend, the main thing on his mind is that he is happy that nobody was hurt,” a source close to Rob EXCLUSIVELY tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Rob is totally right not to contact Reese, because she enough to deal with at the moment. It’s so sweet of him to be concerned, however.</p><h3>Reese Witherspoon Apologizes After Disorderly Conduct Arrest</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>Reese released a statement on April 21, apologizing for her behavior. While Reese’s husband James was arrested for DUI, Reese was allegedly hanging out of a car window, and was really rude to a police officer.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Out of respect for the ongoing legal situation, I cannot comment on everything that is being reported right now. But I do want to say I clearly had one drink too many and I am deeply embarrassed about the things I said. It was definitely a scary situation and I was frightened for my husband, but that was no excuse. I was disrespectful to the officer who was just doing his job. I have nothing but respect for the police and I am very sorry for my behavior.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Reese and her husband are scheduled to appear in court on April 22 at 8 AM, though neither is expected to show and a lawyer will reportedly ask for a postponement.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>What do YOU think <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?

His professional career has been active since 1989.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Phil Rosenthalis is? According to sources, it is estimated that the overall size of Phil’s net worth is as high as $75 million, as of early 2016. The main source of this amount of money is his successful involvement in the film industry. He has also been recognized as an author, which has also been one of the sources of his wealth.<br>[divider]</p><h3>Phil Rosenthal Net Worth $75 Million</h3><p>Phil Rosenthal was raised in a Jewish family in New City, New York, where he attended Clarkstown North High School, during which he started showing an interest in acting, and became active in the school’s drama club. After high school, in 1977 he enrolled at Hofstra University to study theatre, and he graduated with a BA degree in 1981.</p><p>Phil`s career began in the early 1980s, firstly as an actor, however, after several years without major success, he switched his focus to writing and producing. His first accomplishment as a writer was his contribution to the comedy series “Baby Talk” (1991), and two years after, he was hired as a writer for another comedy series, “Coach” (1993-1996). In 1996, his life changed for the better, when he and actor <a href=#>Ray Romano</a> collaborated to start a TV series entitled “Everybody Loves Raymond”. Phil was one of the writers, and the executive producer of the show, which ran for 10 seasons until 2005, increasing Phil`s net worth to a large degree over those years. Thanks to the popularity of the series, Phil`s name became well known in the film-making industry, which resulted in creation of new series, and films, but it also led to a number of appearances in TV series and films, such as “Spanglish” (2004), “Curb Your Enthusiasm” (2005), and “30 Rock” (2011), among others, all of which added to his net worth.</p><p>To speak further of his accomplishments in the entertainment industry, he served as a writer for such productions as “America: A Tribute to Heroes” (2001), “Earth To America” (2005), and his most recent creations, “The Winklers” (2014), and a Dutch version of “Everybody Loves Raymond”, entitled “Iedereen is gek op Jack” (2011-2012).</p><p>Since 2015, Phil has been featured in the reality TV series “I`ll Have What Phil`s Having”, in which he visits popular restaurants around the world, and tries the local food.</p><p>Over the course of his career, Phil has also published a book entitled “You’re Lucky You ‘re Funny: How Life Becomes a Sitcom” (2006), which also increased his net worth.&nbsp;As an executive producer of the “Everybody Loves Raymond”, Phil received two Primetime Emmy Awards, in 2003 and 2005.</p><p>Speaking about his personal life, Phil Rosenthal has been married to actress Monica Horan since April of 1990. They have two children and currently live in Burbank, California.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=24.107782101167><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Philip Rosenthal</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$75 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1963-07-14</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Profession</td><td>Record producer, Screenwriter, Television producer, Author, Film director, Actor, Songwriter</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Hofstra University, Clarkstown High School North</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Jennie Zbikowski</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Lily Rosenthal, Ben Rosenthal</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Richard Rosenthal</td></tr><tr readability=0.30188679245283><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/philrosenthalofficial</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.32558139534884><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/philrosenthal</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0742814/</a></td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Awards</td><td>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, Honorary Clio Award, Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Episodic Comedy, James Beard Award for Television Program, On Location, Writers Guild of America Award -

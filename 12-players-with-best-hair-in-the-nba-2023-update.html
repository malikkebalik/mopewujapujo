Robin Lopez</h3><p>The Lopez family is blessed with the best genetics. Jennifer Lopez, the American singer, is one of the most beautiful females in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the basketball player <a href=#>Robin Lopez</a> and Jennifer are not related. However, they are blessed with heights, talent, and good hair.</p><p>Robin is the brother of the 2021 NBA champion <a href=# rel=noopener>Brook Lopez</a>. Although Brook likes to keep things simple with his hair, as he has an army cut, his brother likes it funkier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Robin_Lopez_Hornets-803x1024.jpg><p>His hair is one of the curliest hairs in the league. Many would term his massive curly hair untidy as it fiddles around his head, but he loves it.</p><p>When the media asked about his hair preference, he said this is how he likes to roll. This answer is the most Robin Lopez way possible.</p><p>Moreover, Lopez doesn’t care that he lets his massive hair flow free during games.</p><p>While many might disagree with having Robin on the list of the best hair in the NBA, he certainly does not care.</p><h3>11. Elfrid Payton</h3><p><a href=#>Elfrid Payton</a> had one of the most recognizable hairlines in the NBA. This statement was true until he decided to trim his signature hair in 2018.</p><p>Further, his hairstyle was the most joked-about hairline in the league. His flopsy part hanging over his eyes got in the opponent’s way.</p><p>As a result, many players had difficulty guarding him or playing him one-on-one. As a result, many fans named it the “Elfrid Payton stopper” or “the best defender in the NBA.”</p><p>Not only that, but the hair also got in his way. Hence, there is huge evidence that his hair might be the reason for his broken jumper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Elfrid-Payton-During-His-Time-With-The-Orlando-Source-Beacherreport.com_.jpg><p>Even his former Magic teammates believe that his hair came in his way of performance. Therefore, even his teammates were excited when he decided to cut his hair.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Evan Fournier</a> tweeted, “he finally did it” with a picture of his trimmed hair on Twitter.</p><p>His long hair was a patch with his high school team. All the team members promised not to cut their hair until they won state championships.</p><p>However, they failed to win the championships. As a result, Payton’s teammates decided to cut their hair, except for Payton.</p><p>When his teammates forced him to cut his hair, he denied saying that he liked his long hair and was thinking of growing them more.</p><p>Payton now has a short half-buzz cut.</p><p>He recently joined Fort Wayne Mad Ants on February 8, 2023.</p><h3>10. Markelle Fultz</h3><p>Markell Fultz is a starting point guard for the Orlando Magic of the NBA.</p><p><a href=#>Fultz</a> was a first overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. However, his performance didn’t live up to their expectations.</p><p>As a result, in just three years with the 76ers, they traded him to the Orland Magic. Even though he is behind in proving his worth to the NBA, he is still having a good season.</p><p>If not for his gameplay, he gets highlighted for his different hairstyle. Previously as a member of the 76ers, he had soft skin fade with short twists on top.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Markelle_Fultz-683x1024.jpg><p>Further, after being traded to the Magic, the point guard has grown his hair. Hence, now he has long and thick hair that comes through his forehead.</p><p>This look has improved his appearance in the game. In addition, the long hair goes well with the tattoos he has all over his arm.</p><p>Overall the basketball player may not have proved his point on the court yet, but he has certainly made a point in the conversation about the best hair in the NBA.</p><h3>9. Mike Conley Jr.</h3><p>Mike Conley Jr. is one of those who have very superstitious beliefs regarding his hair. He usually prefers his hair twisted in a dreadlock.</p><p>However, <a href=#>Conley</a> frequently switches from braids to dreadlocks throughout various games.</p><p>This action generated a huge debate online about whether he plays better in any style.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mike-Conley-Jr.-With-A-Man-Bun-Source-WREG.com_.jpg><p>Hence, when a reporter asked him about his hairstyle change, he said he kept dreadlocks when his team won and opened them when they lost.</p><p>This doesn’t affect much of his playing style. However, this is a method of constantly reminding himself that he doesn’t want to lose two games in a row.</p><p>Quite shockingly, his team rarely ever lost two games in a row. Besides that, his hair looked great in both hairstyles.</p><p>Especially when the Jazz’s point guard ties his hair with a rubber, he looks flawless. Therefore, he will always be a top candidate when discussing the best hair in the NBA.</p><p>However, in 2023 he has a short Afro haircut, as seen in his Instagram posts.</p><h3>8. Derrick Rose</h3><p><a href=#>Derrick Rose</a> is one of the most loved players in the league and one of the basketball players with the best hair in the NBA.</p><p>Basketball fans have a profound connection with Rose and his playing career. During his prime, he was the next big-time behind <a href=#>Jordan</a> in the Bulls franchise.</p><p>However, injuries got the best of the point guard, and as a result, he had to go through multiple surgeries.</p><p>His recovery phase toned a lot of emotion, especially when he got traded from the Bulls. He didn’t have the same explosiveness as he used to, with multiple injuries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Derrick-Rose.jpg><p>Nevertheless, his comeback story from a broken foot to still playing in the league inspired many fans. But it’s not the only thing that fans across the league praise.</p><p>The fans love Rose’s braided look, most notably during his Detroit Pistons tenure. As a Pistons player, he had a long dreadlock that he used to tie with a rubber.</p><p>Similarly, the former league MVP has changed his hair frequently and nailed it every time. Even right now, in his short afro look, he looks flawless.</p><h3>7. Robert Covington</h3><p>Robert Covington, an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Clippers, plays the position of small forward and power forward.</p><p>He might not look big down the post, but he knows how to move around that area. In addition, his explosiveness and game IQ are well-appreciated in the league.</p><p>To be a great basketball player, he also knows how to work around his style. He is frequently seen changing his hairstyle season after season.</p><p><a href=#>Covington</a> has tried all of Mohawk, braids, or fancy top-up dreadlocks. His looks are different, yet they look very charming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Robert-Covington.png><p>However, this was not always the scenario. In Robert’s rookie season with the 76ers, he had the most awful-looking haircut.</p><p>He had grown top-up curly hair with a soft skin fade. The haircut made his head look much bigger than his body.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, that was in his past.</p><p>Covington now has thin braids that look even better with the NBA-advised headgear.</p><h3>6. Kelly Olynyk</h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Canadian professional basketball player&nbsp;</span><a href=#><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Kelly Olynyk</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true> plays for the Utah Jazz of the NBA. He was a 13th overall pick of the Dallas Mavericks in the 2013 draft.</span></p><p>He has long hair that comes just beneath his shoulder. He has been growing his hair ever since his collegiate career.</p><p>The craze for long hair began when his two roommates made him watch soccer. Long hair with a headband was very famous in Europe during that time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Kelly-Olynyk-Chopped-His-Hair-For-Donation-To-The-Kids-Source-Instagram.jpg><p>Therefore, the Piston’s big man was inspired by <a href=# rel=noopener>Sergio Ramos</a>‘ long hair to start growing his hair.</p><p>In particular, he loved how the European players wore headbands while having their hair behind their ears.</p><p>Hence, he started growing his hair and wearing headbands during games.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, an interesting fact about Kelly is that he decided to cut his hair in Canada instead of the U.S.</p><p>Olynyk says there is no specific reason for Canadian-only salon visits. It’s just that he’s more focused on his career during his time in the U.S.</p><p>Kelly, in 2023 is still maintaining his long hairstreak, which looks nourished.</p><h3>5. Ricky Rubio</h3><p>With his aggressive gameplay and charming looks, the Spanish point guard <a href=#>Ricky Rubio</a> can knock people off. Most credit for his fascinating looks goes to his silky and shiny hair.</p><p>However, this was not the case from the beginning for the player. He was far from being called the “Boy Wonder” in his rookie year.</p><p>He had straight, dense hair with a bushy beard. Many people don’t believe they are the same guy while comparing his pictures now and in his rookie year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ricky_Rubio-683x1024.jpg><p>His style transformation has left many clueless and inspired. Further, Ricky himself feels more confident with his current transformation.</p><p>This whole transformation began with him letting his hair grow.</p><p>In addition, to a good vibe, he was also playing better basketball. Personally, Rubio rocks a man bun as it’s more stylish.</p><p>During game time, he likes to put on gel since he doesn’t like getting his hair in the way.</p><p>Either way, his Spanish genetics surely has helped him become one of the players with the best hair in the NBA.</p><h3>4. Steven Adams</h3><p>In particular, the NBA’s Aquaman is not a huge fan of long hair. However, since his third season in the NBA, Adams had already started growing them.</p><p><a href=#>Steven</a> explained in an interview with New Zealand’s Sky Sports that he&nbsp;was tired of paying $60 for haircuts. So, as a result, he let them grow as much as possible.</p><p>$60 every month is a hard hit to anyone’s income. So being smart, the Grizzlies center decided to save money instead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Steven-Adams.png><p>Besides that, the New Zealander loves his hair now. When asked whether he wants to cut his hair in the future, his answer was a straight no.</p><p>With the signature New Zealand cultured tattoo combination, he looks great. While playing, he prefers to tie his long curly hair into a man bun.</p><p>There was a time when he let his hair flow free during the game. This was back during his OKC rookie days.</p><p>Paired with his gorgeous beard, he is one of the most charming guys in the NBA. Overall, the big man’s hair is one of the best in the NBA.</p><h3>3. DeAndre Jordan</h3><p><a href=#>DJ</a> has been blessed with some tremendous Afro-American genes for his hair. But, unfortunately, the backup center for the Philadelphia 76ers might be way past his prime in basketball.</p><p>His current look is most certainly in the style game. Initially, he had a top-up curl with twists on top.</p><p>With his French beard and twisted hair, he looked earnest. But, ironically, he is one of the nicest players in the NBA, as per the players and media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DeAndre-Jordan-During-His-Time-With-The-Brooklyn-Nets-Source-Bleacherreport.com_.jpg><p>Hence, this is another reason for not jumping and judging a book by its cover, but coming back to the topic, he started growing his hair after his trade from LAC.</p><p>Jordan had already grown his hair to his shoulder during his final years as a Clipper center.</p><p>He needed the hair to grow a bit more for his favorite dreadlock. There was a huge hype around social media when DJ shared his first look in dreadlocks.</p><p>Initially, the dreadlock was curled, which gave him a more intense look. Later, the veteran center decided to go all the way in terms of his hair.</p><h3>2. Ja Morant</h3><p><a href=#>Ja Morant</a> is famous in the league for his explosive gameplay and hairstyle. After Morant came out with his free-form dreadlocks, many youths were seen copying his looks.</p><p>Pop stars such as Lil Wayne and Lil Durk wear such hairstyles. However, the All-Star starter usually likes to tie his hair during the game.</p><p>While most players would tie their hair backward, he prefers a ponytail. He also preferred tying it from behind, but a funny incident invited his new style.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ja_Morant_dribbling-720x1024.jpg><p>While playing against the Timberwolves, Ja lost two bobby pins in the middle of the game. As a result, he improvised and tied his hair in a ponytail for the second half.</p><p>With his newly invented hairstyle, he exploded for Grizzlies’ victory. No one can tell what happened. Was it the hair that got the Wolves’ defender’s attention?</p><p>No matter what, he liked his new hairstyle. Therefore, he is frequently seen tying his hair in a ponytail during game time.</p><h3>1. JaVale McGee</h3><p><a href=#>JaVale McGee</a> has always been on top of his game regarding his hairdo. However, he never fails to surprise his fans with funky yet bizarre hairstyles.</p><p>He made plenty of headlines while playing for the Golden State Warriors due to his weird grooming style, as reported by <a href=# rel=noopener>CBSSports</a>. First, he shaved his head completely while leaving a strain of hair in the bottom.</p><p>However, this is not where he stopped. For game time, he braided the small strains of hair in the bottom of his head.</p><p>The braids were in the shape of a triangle. Hence, multiple fans took it to social media, trolling and rooting for the big man’s style.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/JaVale-McGees-Back-Braid-Source-Bleachersreport.jpg><p>After joining the Lake Show, he grew his hair into a soft skin fade with short twists on top. Likewise, over the year, he grew the twists into braids.</p><p>Especially during the Laker’s championship season, he vlogged himself having designs for his long braids. Due to Covid, the NBA created a&nbsp;bio-secure bubble inside the Walt Disney World.</p><p>Since the protocol didn’t allow him to get outside, he had multiple hairdos inside the bubble.</p><p>Nineteen episodes range from the first day of the bubble to the last victorious day. Hence, he was seen showing his lifestyle inside the bubble.</p><p>In 2023, McGee is rocking his lowkey stylish military-style crew cut.</p><p>Overall, McGee will never be forgotten for having the best hair in the NBA.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>A hairstyle might not make a huge difference for a player during game time. But it most certainly makes a difference in one’s personal life.</p><p>Stuff like hairstyle, facial hair, height, and clothing makes a male attractive. Therefore, players in the NBA are always on top of their game in style and basketball.</p><p>Hence, let’s appreciate these individuals for having one of the best hairs in the NBA.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCuxKyrZqCRnr9utc1mq6GdXaOvons%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./top-10-best-thermodynamics-books-reviews-and-expert-picks-for-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Top 10 Best Thermodynamics Books - Reviews and Expert Picks For 2023</span></a>

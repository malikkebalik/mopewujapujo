He is also a member of the funk band War, and all of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Eric Burdon? As of early-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $5 million, mostly earned through success in the music industry. He is noted for his aggressive stage performance and is ranked by Rolling Stone as one of “The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time”. All of these achievements have ensured the position of his wealth.</p><h3>Eric Burdon Net Worth $5 million</h3><p>Eric started earning popularity as the lead singer of the band The Animals which was formed in 1962; they combined rock and electric blues becoming one of the leading bands of the British Invasion era. The group introduced British fashion and music, performing alongside names including The Beatles, and became known for their various singles including “The House of the Rising Sun”, “Baby Let Me Take You Home” and “It’s My Life”. His net worth started to increase significantly thanks to their popularity.</p><p>After several members left the band, Eric reformed it with drummer Barry Jenkins under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals. This incarnation was more psychedelic and they had hits including “When I Was Young”, “Ring of Fire”, and “San Franciscan Nights”. In 1975, the original band reunited for the album “Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted”, and they then released another album in 1983 entitled “Ark” which contained the single “The Night”. They followed this up with a world tour before their final performance in 1984, but Burdon continued playing music with the band Eric Burdon and the New Animals. They went on to release various live recordings and these continued to increase his net worth. He continues to perform today, with The Animals consisting of members Johnzo West, Dustin Koester, Justin Andres, Davey Allen, Ruben Salinas, and Evan Mackey.</p><p>Aside from The Animals, Burdon also joined the funk rock band War. In 1970, they released the album “Eric Burdon Declares “War”” which had singles including “Tobacco Road” and “Spill the Wine”. They then released a double album entitled “The Black-Man’s Burdon” which had moderate success. In 1976, they released a compilation album called “Love Is All Around”, before dis-banding although the group reunited to perform in 2008.</p><p>Eric also had a very successful solo career, beginning in 1971 with the Eric Burdon Band. He recorded the album “Guilty!” and performed at various festivals throughout the 1970s. In 1978, he recorded the album “Darkness Darkness” which was released two years later. He performed around the world as a solo artist, accompanied by a backing band. He was also known for forming various groups, changing names, and band members for performances. In 2004, he released the album “My Secret Life” which was considered a comeback album, and also a blues-R&B album entitled “Soul of a Man” in 2006. One of his latest recordings is an EP entitled “Eric Burdon & the Greenhornes” which featured him performing at 71 years old.</p><p>Burdon has also done some acting, mainly appearing in independent films.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Eric has married three times, firstly to Marianna Proestou, and then to Angie King (m. 1967–1969) and Rose Marks (m. 1972–1978) with whom he has a daughter. Since then he has apparently been single.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=17.985966735967><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Eric Burdon</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 11, 1941</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, England</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 7" (1.7 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer-songwriter</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>English, British</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Spouse</td><td>Rose Marks (m. 1972–1978), Angie King (m. 1967–1969), Marianna Proestou</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Alex Burdon</td></tr><tr readability=0.31372549019608><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/officialericburdon</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/ericburdon</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://myspace.com/ericburdon</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0121007/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25396825396825><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eric-burdon-mn0000154548</a></td></tr><tr readability=18><td>Nominations</td><td>NME Award for World Male Singer, NME Award for World Musical Personality, NME Award for British Male Singer, NME Award for British Vocal Personality, Spill the Wine, Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood, When I Was Young, Bremerton, WA, United States, Tacoma, WA, United States, Falmouth, Jamaica</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Movies</td><td>The Doors, Comeback, The Blue Hour, 11th Victim, All My Loving, The British Beat Live!: Best of the '60s, Live at the Ventura Beach California</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=19.191907514451><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>I didn't like punk music but I agreed with what they were saying.</td></tr><tr readability=16.781851512374><td>2</td><td>Yeah, I love jazz. But most of the jazz that I love is of the past. If I listen to jazz, I'm listening to <a href=#>Duke Ellington</a>. If I'm listening to jazz voicings, I'm listening to Joe Turner, Joe Williams, people like that. The concept of the voice within the structure of the music world is a very special thing for me because that's what I do, so I have to make it a special thing. But it is a special thing and the fact that the first, real, original instrument was the human voice when centuries ago the inhabitants of the planet would copy the sound of birds in the trees and all that. That's where singing came from and then it became a way of passing on messages and spreading the news when there was no newspapers, when there was no Internet. There was strolling minstrels who sang the news, they would sing the weather forecast, they would sing the cricket results in their bars. So y'know, the voice is a very special thing and that's why I still make the challenge of getting up in front of an audience and hoping that they'll like what I have to say and the way that I have to say it.</td></tr><tr readability=10.749665327979><td>3</td><td>[<a href=#>Bruce Springsteen</a>] wanted to produce me.

I can't even come up with a reason why I should say no to Springsteen because I love the guy's work and the more I know about him and the people around him, he's a really stand up guy. For a long time I would have a thought now and again 'man, why did I turn Bruce down? What did I do that for?' But I do a lot of things on the spur of the moment and afterwards I think 'what did I do that for? Maybe my dyslexia has something to do with that, I don't know. If you put me in a room two buttons, a green button and a red button and it says 'red button, do not press'... I will. I'll press it. And I'm supposed to press the green one.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>4</td><td>Why would I want to celebrate a band that has driven me so much pain and anguish?

They pressured the Broncos on just 21.6 percent of their dropbacks (29th in the NFL in Week 1) according to TruMedia. Josh Allen and the Bills are coming off a rough offensive showing against the Jets, but it'll be a long afternoon for the Raiders defense if they can't get after the All-Pro quarterback.</p><p>Maxx Crosby was his usual dominant self against the Broncos — and defensive end Malcolm Koonce and defensive tackle Jerry Tillery had their moments — but the Raiders need more members of their defensive line to step up on a more consistent basis. The pass rush looked to be much improved during the offseason, but they still have to prove they can translate that to the regular season.</p><p>Offensively, the Raiders need to do a much better job running the ball in order to give themselves a chance in this one. In Week 1, they finished with just 61 rushing yards and averaged a paltry 2.1 yards per carry.</p><p>The Bills' defense plays almost exclusively with light boxes, which leaves them more susceptible to the run. The Raiders should aim to take advantage by feeding running back Josh Jacobs, who should be in better position to make an impact after knocking the rust off last week. Especially with receiver Jakobi Meyers out due to a concussion, I'd be pretty surprised if the Raiders don't take a run-heavy approach today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57y6KtnmWSobyov46nnaVlo5i8s7HSZqqtmaSoeqm1xqGjop%2BYqcBuuMivnGatoJmutbHSaIdxiYijkY%2FAlI2oimeBraato9KbfYeeiIR8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nikocado-avocado-height-weight-age-spouse-family-facts-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Nikocado Avocado Height, Weight, Age, Spouse, Family, Facts, Biography</span></a>

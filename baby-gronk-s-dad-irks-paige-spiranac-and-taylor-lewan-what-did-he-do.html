However, some social media users did criticize Miguel for sneaking into the DMs of Spiranac and Lewan.</p><h2 class=split>Baby Gronk's father slid into the DMs of celebrities</h2><p>The controversy started when Lewan tweeted a screenshot of Baby Gronk's father DMing him on Instagram in an attempt to get Madden on the 'Bussin' With The Boys' podcast, which he co-hosts with fellow NFL player Will Compton. "Baby Gronks dad... woof," Lewan tweeted along with the screenshot containing several messages from the "Baby Gronk" account, which is managed by the 10-year-old's father.</p><p>Spiranac, a TikTok star and former professional golfer, also tweeted a screenshot with messages from Baby Gronk's father, showing the user reached out to her on Instagram, requesting a "collab."</p><h2 class=split>Fans concerned about Baby Gronk</h2><p>Baby Gronk initially became an internet phenomenon after demonstrating his football skills. It's safe to say that the 10-year-old is more popular than most children his age, and his father, Miguel, has done everything in his power to make him even more famous. However, Miguel's attempts were not well received, with many admirers believing that the father was exploiting his child for fame, leading fans to express their concern for Baby Gronk in the past few days.</p><p>After the release of tweets, a user wrote, "Either this kid will end up being the next gronk or the next Delonte West. No in between," expressing their thoughts on the situation. One wrote, "Creep wants a kid on “Busting in the Boys” arrest this man," clearly blaming Miguel for his actions. "Exploiting your kid for clout, brutal," remarked a user on Spiranac's tweet.&nbsp;</p><p class=custom-cursor-default-hover dir=ltr lang=en>Either this kid will end up being the next gronk or the next Delonte West.

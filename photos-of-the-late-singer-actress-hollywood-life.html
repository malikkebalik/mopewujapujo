She was born in London, England and started her acting career by auditioning in the 1960s. Although she was initially insecure about her looks, she continued with pursuing her creative dreams and had her first acting appearance with an uncredited role in 1965’s ‘The Knack …and How to Get It.’ The next year, she really blew up on the scene in 1966’s ‘Blow Up’ followed by ‘Kaleidoscope’ and ‘Wonderwall.’</p><p>The Birkin bag bag was created by Hermès , the Parisian luxury label, in 1984 after former CEO Jean-Louis Dumas was enamored by Jane during a flight from Paris to her hometown of London. The two allegedly discussed Jane’s challenges to find a bag that fit everything she needed as a then-mom of two younger children — leading Jean to create the Birkin tote.</p><p>Jane sadly died at the age of 76 on July 16, 2023, after a number of previous health struggles.

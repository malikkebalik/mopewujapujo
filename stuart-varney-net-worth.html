Being a successful business expert has significantly increased his net worth.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Stuart Varney is, as of mid-2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Stuart Varney’s net worth is as high as $10 million, an amount he has earned through his successful career as a journalist. In addition to his work in business journalism, Varney worked as a broadcaster and reporter early in his career, which also improved his wealth.</p><h3>Stuart Varney Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>Stuart Varney studied at the London School of Economics from where he graduated, but in the meantime, he worked for a year in Nairobi, Kenya. He then moved to Hong Kong to work as a reporter at Radio Hong Kong, and later switched to the US where he got a job as a broadcaster at KEMO-TV in San Francisco. In 1980, Varney joined the newly opened CNN network, and launched his career in business journalism as a host of CNN shows “Business Day, Business Asia” and co-host of “Moneyline” along with Willow Bay. His net worth was rising stesdily.</p><p>Varney started at CNN, but after 21 years left for CNBC in 2001, where he got the job to host “Wall Street Journal Editorial Board with Stuart Varney”, a position he held for three years, during which time his net worth increased a lot. After that he moved to join the Fox News Channel’s business team, and has subsequently worked as an anchor of Fox Business Network since its establishment in 2007, increasing further his net worth. After joining Fox, Varney worked simultaneously on weekdays and weekend business-related programs such as “Bulls & Bears”, “Cash In”, “Cavuto on Business”, and “Your World with Neil Cavuto”, which also added to his net worth.</p><p>Stuart Varney raised some controversy in 2013 with commenting on Pope Francis’ criticism of capitalism when the Pope described it as the system that rules rather than serves. At the moment, Varney is working as a co-host on “Varney & Co”, an American cable television news and talk show that airs from 9:00 am to 12 pm every weekday. Liz MacDonald and Ashley Webster also co-host the show, and it includes current events coverage, interviews and commentary with Wall Street experts, and market coverage. Varney is also a regular in “Cashin’ In”, a business analysis program which is aired since 2002.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Stuart Varney began to live in the USA in 1974, and lives with his wife Debora and six children in New Jersey. However, after 21 years of marriage, his wife apparently filed for divorce, alleging that Stuart had a nine-year affair with a woman from Orlando, Florida. Varney’s daughter Jill Meyer won $25,000 at “Hotel Showcase”, a show aired on Travel Channel. Varney is an American citizen since 2015.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=8.7349397590361><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Stuart Varney</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 7, 1949</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Derbyshire, United Kingdom</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Business journalist</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>London School of Economics and Political Science</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British, American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Deborah Varney</td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/Varneyco</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3268459/</a></td></tr><tr readability=11><td>TV Shows</td><td>Varney & Co.

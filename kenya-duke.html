Gary later posted on Instagram, telling Delta Airlines, “Now my wife is a Black lady.” The gentleman in front of her is white, and the ticket seller is white. ‘Are you in first?’ he inquired of the Black lady. The white guy, however, is not one of them. So, Delta, I’ve racked up nearly 3 million miles with you. That’s my wife you’ll see when you see her. She is the first to take to the air. Please don’t inquire. When it comes to Gary, he is opposed to racial prejudice. He is so devoted to his gorgeous wife that he always stands by her side.</p><h2>Age and Body Dimensions</h2><p>Kenya Duke, in terms of age, is 47 years old as of 2021.

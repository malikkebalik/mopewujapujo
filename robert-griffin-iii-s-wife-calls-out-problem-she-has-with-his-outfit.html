Grete Griffin, the wife of former NFL quarterback and current ESPN analyst Robert Griffin III, called out the lone issue she had with her husband’s on-air look Tuesday, which consisted of a navy suit and white sneakers.
In a video posted Tuesday to ESPN’s X account, Griffin can be seen sitting in a chair, seemingly leaning forward, while awaiting the return of former co-analyst Jeff Saturday, who served as interim coach for the Colts part of last season."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, she was unable to attend Thanksgiving dinner that year.</p><p>Dr. Sarah earned her four-year DPM (Doctor of Podiatric Medicine) degree from Barry University in 2013 as a result of her education. Before that, she earned a Bachelor of Science from Columbia College (SC) with a major in Biology/Biological Sciences (2005 -2009).</p><h2><span id=Height_Weight_and_Distinct_Characteristics>Height, Weight, and Distinct Characteristics</span></h2><p><strong>Dr. Sarah Haller is a tall woman, standing at 5 feet 8 inches (172 cm) and weighing less than 56 kg (123 lbs).</strong></p><p>To begin, Dr. Sarah has the rare Hazel eye color (less than 5% of the world’s population).

This is a rough estimate and does not include her compensation from TLC’s reality show. Dr. Sarah had worked as a physician at Essex Union Podiatry for over three years as of 2021.</p><p>Dr. Ebonie Vincent and Dr. Brad Schaeffer, her co-stars, were also members of the Podiatry. Dr. Sarah previously spent four and a half years as a fellow at Weil Foot Ankle and Orthopedic Institute.</p><p>Dr. Sarah completed her residency at CarePoint Health System from July 2013 to June 2016.</p><h2><span id=Husband_Boyfriend_and_Fiance_of_Dr_Sarah_Haller>Husband, Boyfriend, and Fiance of Dr. Sarah Haller</span></h2><p>Fans, take a seat! Dr. Sarah Haller is already involved with a man. Andre Ross, like Dr. Sarah, is a physician who previously worked as a resident physician at Hoboken University Medical Center.</p><p>It is unknown, however, whether Andre was her boyfriend or husband. While it was confirmed that the two were dating, it was unclear whether they ever married.</p><p>According to our sources, Dr. Sarah Haller also maintained an Instagram account called “Sarah Ross”; this could be a hint that Andre “Ross” was her husband. Additionally, the couple became engaged in November 2019 and it is possible that they held a secret wedding in the interim. Dr. Sarah and Andre Ross will hold the title of finance until the situation is resolved.</p><p>Dr. Sarah appeared to have dated Andre at least since February 2016, according to their dating history. Speculatively, we believe that their professional paths may have brought them together.</p><p>This should have clarified things for those of you who were shipping Dr. Sarah with Dr. Brad Schaeffer. Dr. Sarah stated that she and Dr. Brad were “close friends” for over eight years.</p><p>Additionally, fans ship Dr. Brad and Dr. Ebonie Vincent.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>physician</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Michelle Fox</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Sam McInerney</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfmb9uv8CrmKFlmJa5rbHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bio-net-worth-relationship-and-family.html><span>←</span><span>Bio, Net Worth, Relationship, And Family</span></a>

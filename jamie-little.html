She was also the daughter of the Interior Designer, Debby Little, and the cruise chef, Laura Thomas. Jamie’s childhood, however, would be riddled with ups and downs, as her parents split at the age of five. Jamie Little Alma Mater; University of San Diego State<br>As an American, the sportscaster is also a Christian studying. In addition, the American attended the Green Valley high school and spent time as a junior in lacrosse.</p><p>Similarly, fame came on a plate to Little. Because of her ability in wrestling and basketball, she was one of the most popular girls in high school and sometimes spoke about school facilities.</p><p>The sweetheart graduated from high school and then entered the State University of San Diego on a sports scholarship. The Californian will also be able to broadcast Supercross Racing and earn a degree in sports journalism at college.</p><h2><span id=Jamie_Little_Age_height_Body_Measurements>Jamie Little Age, height & Body Measurements</span></h2><p>The sportscaster is actually 41 years old. In addition, her age has not slowed her down because she is as vibrant as the previous days of her career. Little is as critical for her employers even at the age of 41 as she was in her younger years.</p><p>A family and in particular the mother of two could not dent the career of the Californian in any way. It is only surprising and a fascinating surprise that a working-class woman has time for her personal and professional duties. We must also commend a woman like Jaimie. Since it is not easy to break into the male-dominated occupation and shine among her male peers who were all well-known figures.</p><p>In addition, being a woman was usually a problem of this kind, let alone the position of a pit reporter for a major networking firm and for one of the most remarkable sports. It is never enough to have questions and a smile; you must constantly plan for extreme pressure and rage of the racers. Furthermore, nothing was able to face the robust reporter at 5’10’ (1,80 m), who paved the way for many women who want to join the sports arena. Given its size, she’s soft-speaking and friendly; a woman with a mic, headphones, and a long pony is really hard to miss.</p><p>More specifically, California has an incredible 37-inch breast body measurement, 26-inch waist, and 37-inch hips. Jaimie’s unbelievably striking attribute is her Pan Am smile, her button nose, and her blonde-brown hair tied to a long ponytail.</p><h2><span id=Jamie_Little_Career_Personality_Sportscaster_Tv>Jamie Little Career: Personality Sportscaster & Tv</span></h2><p>Speaking of her career, in early 1996 Jaimie moved on to sports broadcasting and worked as a sideline reporter for ABC Sports as a college senior. The Californian repeatedly claimed that she wanted to use her voice and personality for her love for racing.</p><p>She eventually behaved according to her reasons and ran one day to a man holding an ESPN mic and begged for a chance. As a result, it was two and a half years after 4 a.m. And running around on the race tracks with the said man. In addition, Jaimie didn’t earn a dollar but gained useful insights into having important questions and improving work ethics. Little was a single woman, breaking down the hurdles and opening up new possibilities in a world surrounded by men.</p><p>Likewise, in 1998, the Californian began his career as a major reporter covering the Winter and Summer X Games. Although still at the beginning of her career, the sportscaster worked as an Indy Racing League pit reporter. Little then worked as an ESPN Motorworld reporter. She was eventually called upon to cover the Winter X Games, where most of the time, one could see her at the Snowmobile Motocross Games.</p><p>Jaimie also acted as host for ESPN’s New Year’s No Limits Special segment. FOX Sports purchased its services in early 2015, following a fruitful run with the ESPN network, thereby appointing it like a NASCAR pit reporter.</p><p>Apart from her job as a reporter, Little took time to write a book titled “Essential Car Care For Women,” from her hectic schedule. Danielle McCormick, Discovery Channel’s Turbo Specialist, helped to write this book.</p><h2><span id=Jamie_Little_Net_Worth_and_salary>Jamie Little Net Worth and salary</span></h2><p>The sportscaster in particular racked up an incredible net worth of 2 million dollars in her two-decade career on the sidelines. In addition, a sideline reporter pockets an average annual salary of $25k to $85k.</p><p>We speak, however, of a woman who consolidated her role as an endowed reporter. Her salaries are therefore a minimum of $50k and a maximum of $85k. But we feel that a woman as talented as Jaimie could earn comparatively more. Likewise, when it came to their salaries women had always had to stand by. Is it relevant if you’re a male, a woman, or a transgender? Their gender identity should not be the basis of one’s reward. If you do the job and do it well, you deserve fair remuneration. Nevertheless, Jaimie is paid because she is the proud owner of a Firebird Pontiac, a cherished possession purchased in 2002. In addition, the Californian also owns a Toyota Sequoia and a Yukon SUV. In total, car prices total approximately $2 million.Toyota and Lexus Jeeps of Jamie Little<br>On the other hand, Little is co-owner of one of Las Vegas’ Jimmy John’s franchises and later opened a joint venture, with her husband, Nothing Bundt Cakes Shop. We should repeat, in other words, that Little leads a fulfilled life.</p><h2><span id=Jamie_Little_Relationship_status>&nbsp;Jamie Little Relationship status</span></h2><p>Jaimie is currently a married woman. The sportscaster also ties the knot in 2010 to Cody Selman. Even though they were dating for quite some time, their willingness to cement the relationship led in late December to a nuptial in La Jolla, California.</p><p>Jamie and her two daughters, Little husband<br>Cody is a marketer for medical implants and he also pocks considerable cash. This is apparent because the man looks after his incredible wife and children. In addition, on August 9, 2012, the couple welcomed their firstborn, Carter Selman.</p><p>Likewise, when a daughter, Sierra Lynn Selman, was born on 26 October 2016, the happiness of the couple exceeded the limits. In comparison, she was dated by Adam Hunch, actor Matt Damon and Hugh Gunman before Little met Cody.</p><table class=mytable style=height:100%;width:100% width=100%><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Jamie Little</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td>April 9, 1978</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>South Lake Tahoe, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nick Name</strong></td><td>Jamie</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>Caucasian</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>Green Valley High School; San Diego State University</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horoscope</strong></td><td>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td>Laura Thomas</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>Yes (3: Names Unknown)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>41 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>5’5” (1.67 m)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>54 kg (119 lbs)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shoe Size</strong></td><td>Updating soon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Brunette</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Hazel</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Body Measurement</strong></td><td>37-26-37 inches</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Figure</strong></td><td>Hourglass</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Married</strong></td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Husband</strong></td><td>Cody Selman</td></tr><tr><td><b>Children</b></td><td>Yes (2: Carter Wayne Selman, Sierra Lynn Selman)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Sportscaster, NASCAR Reporter, Television Personality</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$2 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Affiliations</strong></td><td>ESPN, ABC, FOX Sports</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Active Since</strong></td><td>1996</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Social Media</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Twitter</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Businesses</strong></td><td>Jimmy John’s Franchise; Nothing Bundt Cakes Store</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Salary</strong></td><td>$50,000(yearly)</td></tr></tbody></table><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Guy Goma</a></h3>Guy Goma estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

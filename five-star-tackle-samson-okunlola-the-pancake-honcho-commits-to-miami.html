But there are some who believe he might be the best offensive tackle prospect in the country.</p><p>“He has shown to be dominant, albeit against lesser competition,” ESPN national recruiting analyst Tom Luginbill said. “However, his measurables and stature along with his athleticism allow for a very high ceiling for development and an adjustment period to the caliber of players around him. He is far from being maxed out, which gives him outstanding upside.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>BRICK WALL 🧱</p><p>This is what an MVP camp performance looks like 😤</p><p>Samson Okunlola (<a href=#>@SAMSONOKUNLOLA_</a>) is a dog! 🐶 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/00xt36SwPq</a></p><p>— The Underclassman Report (@TheUCReport) <a href=#>May 9, 2022</a></p><p>Charles Fishbein of Elite Scouting Services — based out of Florida — said Okunlola is the best offensive tackle in the country in his eyes.</p><p>“He’s unreal,” Fishbein said. “He and Mauigoa will be the best offensive linemen Miami signs since Seantrel Henderson. There’s a video of Okunlo;a sitting on the ground with his legs in front of him and he jumps up and does that kick slide step linemen do. I’ve never seen a kid that size move like that. He’s a freak. I’ll be surprised if that kid isn’t a Day 1 starter. Mauigoa is really good — I’m not saying he isn’t at all. I just like Okunlola a little more.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Okunlola <a href=#>visited Michigan State</a>, Alabama and Miami in June and attended the Hurricanes’ humiliating 45-3 loss to rival <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Florida State</a> at home on Nov. 5 before taking his final official visit to the University of Florida last week. The visit to Gainesville appeared to go really well. But Miami’s coaching staff had the last word, visiting with Okunlola in person Tuesday evening.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>5⭐️ day in the life of a Florida Visit???<a href=#>@Gainesvisuals</a> <a href=#>#PancakeHoncho</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UAVn1lXJ7G</a></p><p>— Samson Okunlola ‘23 (@SAMSONOKUNLOLA_) <a href=#>December 14, 2022</a></p><p>“I met with them briefly,” Thayer Academy coach Jeff Toussaint said. “First time I met Mario, but I knew (Miami offensive line coach) Alex (Mirabal) really well. He’s recruited our guys before and we have a mutual friend (Miami Columbus High coach) in Dave Dunn. I sent (Dunn) some players when he was the head coach at (Division III) Catholic (University) in Washington D.C. It was a great fit for a lot of our guys.”</p><p>Okunlola’s parents were born in Nigeria, but he and his siblings were born in Brockton, Mass. His older brother, Samuel, a three-star edge rusher in the Class of 2022, signed with <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Pittsburgh</a> last year.</p><p>The younger Okunlola won a New England Independent Sports League wrestling title as a junior and threw the shot put and discus in high school. Toussaint said Okunlola benches 345 pounds and squats 495 pounds.</p><p>“Personality wise, he’s a great kid,” Toussaint said. “He just turned 18 in October. He likes hanging out with his friends. He likes joking around and stuff. But as a football player, I’ve never seen a kid, other than his brother, be so dedicated to working out and into making himself the best player he can possibly be.</p><p>“Starting with the COVID year when we didn’t have a season — just working out, doing workouts with a local coach, he and his brother, doing a lot of football drills, a lot of strength and conditioning. That and the fact that he studies the game really intently, I think make him special. A lot of coaches who have been on the recruiting trail have told me he’s the best in the country. They’ve seen all the kids. What’s as important, obviously, is his drive. He just wants to be the best that he can possibly be physically and intelligently.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Appreciate the Pancake Mix from <a href=#>@KodiakCakes</a> , ready to start serving 🥞💪🏾🔥<a href=#>#PancakeHoncho</a> <a href=#>#stackem</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vOji0tcrgS</a></p><p>— Samson Okunlola ‘23 (@SAMSONOKUNLOLA_) <a href=#>December 12, 2022</a></p><p>The potential to sign NIL deals at Miami also played an important factor for Okunlola, who takes his branding as Pancake Honcho very seriously.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Many of Miami’s other 23 commitments made a push to get Okunlola to join the class. Mauigoa, who has been committed since July, told The Athletic last week he spent a lot of time texting Okunlola throughout the process. He’d like for the Hurricanes to have the best offensive line in the country next season.</p><p>“For me, I’m trying to get my O-line straight,” Mauigoa said.</p><p>Miami’s offensive line wasn’t particularly good last season protecting the quarterback, finishing 72nd in sack rate according to Football Outsiders. The team also finished 88th in opportunity rate, which measures the percentage of carries that gain at least 4 yards.</p><p>Starting left tackle John Campbell entered the transfer portal as a grad transfer earlier this week, which means fourth-year junior <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Zion Nelson</a>, who missed most of the 2022 season, is the only returning offensive tackle with starting experience.</p><p>On the interior, third-year sophomore left guard <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jalen Rivers</a>, fourth-year junior center <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jakai Clark</a>, freshman right guard <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Anez Cooper</a> and former Oregon transfers <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jonathan Denis</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Logan Sagapolu</a> all started games in 2022 for the Hurricanes. But Cristobal clearly wants an overhaul at the position.</p><p>Miami’s 2023 offensive line class also includes three three-star recruits in Antonio Tripp of Bradenton (Fla.) IMG Academy, Tommy Kinsler of Ocala (Fla.) Trinity Catholic and Frankie Tinilau of Miami La Salle.</p><p>The Hurricanes are also pushing hard to land former Alabama left guard <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Javion Cohen</a>, a two-year starter for the Crimson Tide, considered one of the best available prospects in the transfer portal. Miami is also still searching for a center to add after losing three-star recruit Conner Lew of Acworth, Ga., to Auburn earlier this week.</p><p>(Photo of Mario Cristobal: Eric Espada / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k2lnb2pkZ3xzfJFrZmpqX2aCcL%2FApqanZZ%2Bgwq%2B4zqWYZqWZlrqqeZRmqq2ZomQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christine-baumgartner-is-19-years-younger-than-her-husband-kevin-costner.html><span>←</span><span>Christine Baumgartner Is 19 Years Younger than Her Husband Kevin Costner</span></a>

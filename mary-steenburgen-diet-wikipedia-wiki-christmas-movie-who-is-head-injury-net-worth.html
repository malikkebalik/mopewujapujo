It was wonderful.</p><p>Steenburgen expresses to ET that she still feels “very deeply” about writing songs and loves acting, and she is equally enthusiastic about her career.</p><p>She stated, “I’m honored to be an actor. “I find it to be both fascinating and challenging, and I’ve never felt like I’ve mastered it. I’m still a student. That’s what makes it intriguing. There is always room for improvement, which is why I adore it.</p><p>Danson concurred, saying that he shares those sentiments with his wife of over 30 years.</p><p>The 75-year-old Danson remarked, “I adore driving through the studio gate and working with crews, writers, and directors. “I enjoy acting very much. I adore it.</p><p>Given their passion for their field, the couple is aware of the difficulties it is now facing, such as the continuing Writers Guild of America, Screen Actors Guild, and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists strikes.</p><p>According to Danson, “It’s easy for actors to deal with losing their jobs, but that’s hard for all the satellite industries that are involved.” People are losing their homes, so it is for real.</p><p>Steenburgen and Danson hurriedly showed up at the event on Sunday to gather money to buy enough food for more than one million meals for those experiencing food insecurity in Los Angeles County, in part because of that circumstance.</p><p>The demand for meals has increased because so many of our employees and the people we’ve worked with are hurting as a result of the strike, Steenburgen said. “This is just an extraordinary organization and this is a moment in time,” Steenburgen added. “Being here is more crucial now than ever.”</p><p>In addition to being overjoyed to host the benefit at their residence, Keith Addis and Keri Selig were also overjoyed to have celebrities like Danson and Steenburgen on board.</p><p>Two million meals are provided by the food bank each month. One-fourth of those go to children who are undernourished, according to Addis. “We joined the board and made the decision to aid in their fund-raising. We have collected enough cash tonight to buy 1.3 million meals.</p><p>We also discovered at COVID that 60% of the folks who arrived in their cars to pick up food boxes had never, ever accepted any aid at all, according to Selig. “You never know when something like this is going to happen when you only need a little help.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Facts_about_Mary_Steenburgen></span><strong>Facts about Mary Steenburgen</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>When Steenburgen was cast as the lead female in the 1978 western Goin’ South, Jack Nicholson first noticed her in the drawing room of Paramount Pictures’ New York office.</li><li>She played the lead in the 1979 movie Time After Time, for which Steenburgen received the Saturn Award for Best Actress.</li><li>Malcolm McDowell, who played novelist H.G.

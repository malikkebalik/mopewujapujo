Not long after that they were even&nbsp;seen locking lips&nbsp;in a&nbsp;club. Their speculated relationship was just reportedly confirmed August 30, when a source told ET that the two are indeed “fully dating.” They also reported that, “No one really knows how long they have been ‘official’ — they just decided to let it become a thing instead of hiding it from everyone.” Since that apparent news broke, the two have been all over each other without a care in the world!

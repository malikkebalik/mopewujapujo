Our investigators have made sure every possible shred of evidence was processed and analyzed in order to bring Kaylin’s killer to justice."</p><p>Fiengo, who also had a 1-year-old son named Ace, was remembered by her parents as a dedicated mother. "Though Kaylin faced [many] challenges that set her apart from her peers in many ways, she made friends everywhere she went," read her obituary. "Kaylin loved spending time with her son, siblings, and friends. Kaylin really was a fun-loving child and had an old soul.”</p><p>Smith expressed hope that Faison's arrest would provide some solace to Fiengo's grieving family. "This beautiful, young woman and mother, was taken from this world far too soon, and in a horrific way... We hope that today’s arrest brings the slightest amount of peace for Kaylin’s family and the young son she left behind. It doesn’t bring her back, but at least she will have the justice she deserves."</p><span class=readpage-disclaimer>Warning: This article contains a recollection of crime and can be triggering to some, readers’ discretion advised.</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjJ2mp6emlrtussCiqqimXZu5sL7InZhmpZGjeqKvwq6qnpxdpLNuv8eopq2hnpx6pbHAnWSpqpWcu6K602aeoqqcm7%2Bqsc2dZGpwXZu8s3nRnp2uq5mjtG6tzWaYm6eiqbawug%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-rental-by-juice-wrld.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Rental by Juice WRLD</span></a>

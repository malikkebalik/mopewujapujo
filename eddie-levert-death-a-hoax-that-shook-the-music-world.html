<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Eddie Levert Death: A Hoax That Shook The Music World</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Eddie Levert, the legendary lead singer of The O’Jays, is still alive and well, despite the rumors that circulated online claiming that he had passed away. The false news of his death caused panic and grief among his fans and fellow musicians, who expressed their condolences and tributes on social media. However, the death hoax was soon exposed as a malicious prank, and Eddie Levert himself confirmed that he was fine and thanked everyone for their concern.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How Did The Death Hoax Start?</strong></h3><p>The origin of the death hoax is unclear, but some sources suggest that it was a result of a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation of an old video that showed Eddie Levert performing at his son Gerald’s funeral in 2006. Gerald Levert, who was also a successful R&B singer and a member of the group LeVert, died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs at the age of 40. Eddie Levert sang a heartfelt rendition of “Wind Beneath My Wings” in honor of his son, and the video went viral on YouTube.</p><p>Some people may have mistaken the video for a recent one, and assumed that Eddie Levert had died and was being honored by his family and friends. Others may have deliberately spread the false news as a cruel joke or a clickbait scheme. Whatever the case, the death hoax quickly gained traction on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, where many users shared their shock and sadness over the supposed loss of Eddie Levert.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How Did Eddie Levert Respond To The Death Hoax?</strong></h3><p>Eddie Levert was unaware of the death hoax until he started receiving phone calls and messages from his worried relatives and friends. He then took to his official Twitter account to set the record straight and assure everyone that he was alive and well. He tweeted:</p><p>“I am not dead. I don’t know where these rumors are coming from. I love you all and I am doing fine.”</p><p>He also posted a video on his Instagram account, where he thanked his fans for their love and support, and joked that he was “too mean to die”. He said:</p><p>“Hey everybody, this is Eddie Levert. I just want to say thank you for all your prayers and all your well wishes. I’m fine, I’m great, I’m wonderful. I don’t know where they’re getting this stuff from that I’m dead. But as you can see, I’m alive and kicking. And I’m too mean to die.”</p><p>He also expressed his frustration over the death hoax, and said that he hoped that whoever started it would be caught and punished. He said:</p><p>“I don’t know who would do something like this. It’s very cruel, it’s very mean, it’s very vicious. And I hope they find out who did it because it’s not funny at all.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How Did The Music World React To The Death Hoax?</strong></h3><p>The music world was relieved to hear that Eddie Levert was alive and well, and many artists and celebrities sent him their messages of support and admiration. Some of them also criticized the death hoax as a disrespectful and insensitive act that hurt Eddie Levert and his family.</p><p>Some of the notable figures who reacted to the death hoax include:</p><ul><li>Smokey Robinson, who tweeted: “I’m so glad to hear that my brother Eddie Levert is OK. He is one of the greatest singers of all time and a dear friend. Whoever started this rumor should be ashamed of themselves.”</li><li>Patti LaBelle, who tweeted: “Eddie Levert is not dead! He is alive and well and still singing his heart out. He is a legend and a treasure. Stop spreading lies about him.”</li><li>Steve Harvey, who tweeted: “Eddie Levert is alive y’all! Stop playing with my emotions like that. He is one of my heroes and mentors. Much love and respect to him.”</li><li>Questlove, who tweeted: “Eddie Levert is one of the reasons why I love music. He is a master of soul and emotion. He is not dead! He is alive and well! Whoever started this rumor needs to get their facts straight.”</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What Is Eddie Levert Doing Now?</strong></h3><p>Eddie Levert is still active in the music industry, performing with The O’Jays and as a solo artist. He recently released a new album called “Family Reunion”, which features collaborations with his son Sean Levert (who died in 2008 due to complications from sarcoidosis), his grandson Cameron Levert, and other members of his family.</p><p>He also continues to inspire and influence many singers and musicians with his powerful voice and style. He has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame, and the Grammy Hall of Fame.</p><p>He is also involved in various charitable causes, such as raising awareness and funds for diabetes research, education, and prevention. He is a spokesperson for the American Diabetes Association, and has participated in several events and campaigns to support the cause.</p><p>Eddie Levert is a living legend, and a hoax that claimed otherwise cannot diminish his legacy and impact. He is still alive and well, and still making music that touches the hearts and souls of millions of people around the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfmrGltcRmo56ulafBbrDEmquhZZFitbCt12aroZmkYsCpu86kZK2glWK6tr%2FInGSwp6KhsXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-steve-carell-leave-show-hollywood-life.html><span>←</span><span>Why Did Steve Carell Leave Show?

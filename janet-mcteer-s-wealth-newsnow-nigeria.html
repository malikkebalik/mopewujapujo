I did it because I loved it and I hardly even got paid.</td></tr><td>2</td><td>New Yorkers are either the nicest or the rudest.</td><td>3</td><td>I just want people to focus on the performance.</td><td>4</td><td>My mother and father are still together after forty something years. I lived in one place till I was 6. I lived in another place from when I was 6 till I was 17.</td><td>5</td><td>But then I got a job selling coffee at the York Theatre, and when I met theatre people, something clicked. I felt comfortable with them; I felt like myself. I decided to go to drama school based just on that feeling. I had never done any acting.</td><td>6</td><td>I’ve always thought if you watch the performance and you don’t know about the person, then you only see the performance.</td><td>7</td><td>People are calling a lot, sending scripts my way. Yes, it’s wonderful because, let’s face it, there aren’t many wonderful scripts for women over the age of 10.</td><td>8</td><td>I do mostly British projects, and for family reasons and life reasons Britain’s my home, where I have a lovely garden.</td><td>9</td><td>When you’re a young English person who wants to be an actress and you have dreams, you dream of being Vanessa Redgrave or Judi Dench.</td><td>10</td><td>When children arrive, or when some crisis occurs, couples don’t have the resources to deal with it because they’ve been so busy getting on with their lives. They haven’t learned how to sit down and discuss things.</td><td>11</td><td>We are a very close family, and I love them very much, but I’m definitely the odd one out. I live a completely different kind of life style. I always was different. I felt like a fish out of water; I really never knew who I was.</td><td>12</td><td>I have very girly hands and I use them a lot when I talk in a way that I think is very feminine.</td><td>13</td><td>Put a Post-It note on your mirror that says: ‘Someone has to succeed. There’s no reason why it shouldn’t be me.’ Repeat before every audition.</td><td>14</td><td>It’s naive to think there is a woman in the world who isn’t brought up to believe that they are waiting for their soul mate. You even see it in Disney.</td><td>15</td><td>I have become a marketing tool and I feel very uncomfortable with that. There’s no space for me to express myself.</td><td>16</td><td>Yes, I was slightly outside everything when I was growing up. My mother jokes that I was exchanged at birth. She brought us up to have traditional values. She was absolutely not part of the ’60s generation.</td><td>17</td><td>[on the day her second Oscar nomination for Albert Nobbs (2011) was announced] “I just had my beady eyes on the television, and when Glenn Close was announced as well, I was very happy. By the time I had finished my day, I was completely exhausted, so we had a low-key celebration; my husband and I drank Champagne, ate cheesecake, and watched Downton Abbey. It doesn’t get better than that.”</td><td>18</td><td>[on being honored with an Oscar nomination for Albert Nobbs (2011)] There were a lot of people who lived like this. One thing you have to remember in England that is different from over here, is that sodomy if you’re a guy was illegal. You’d be kicked out of the country. There was nothing against lesbianism because Queen Victoria didn’t believe it existed.</td><td>19</td><td>[on the Academy Awards] The whole thing was just silly. All those awards are a bit silly, aren’t they? It’s quite funny if you’re English, because we take them all with a bucket of salt really; we’re always a bit embarrassed to go ‘I’d quite like to win that award’. The Americans are very: ‘Oh my God! Is this the most exciting day of your life?’ I just thought ‘no, not really. It’s good fun and you get to see everyone on the carpet, but frankly, get a grip!</td><td>20</td><td>[If someone saw one of your performances in 1,000 years’ time, what would it tell them about the year 2007?] That nothing has really changed. People will still love and hurt and yearn.</td><td>21</td><td>The older you get, the better you get, because you’ve seen more. You don’t necessarily have to go through a lot, but you have to witness it in order to recreate it.</td></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Nominated for the 2009 Tony Award for Best Performance for a Leading Actress in a Play for “Mary Stuart”.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>She was awarded the OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2008 Queen’s Birthday Honours List for her services to drama.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Won Broadway’s 1997 Tony Award as Best Actress (Play) for portraying Nora in a revival of Henrik Ibsen’s “A Doll’s House.”</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Graduated from Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Became an Associate Member of Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>She was awarded the 1996 London Critics Circle Theatre Award (Drama Theatre) for Best Actress for her performance in “A Doll’s House”.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>She was awarded the 1997 Laurence Olivier Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Play, of the 1996 season, for her performance “A Doll’s House”, at the Playhouse.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden=true></span> All pictures</p><h3 class=toggle-head>Actress <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actress><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr></tbody></table><h3>Related posts:</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmihmqaVqXqur9OenKurXayyorjToWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cora-tilley-bio-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Cora Tilley Bio (Wiki)</span></a>

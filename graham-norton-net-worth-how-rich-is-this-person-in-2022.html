He is an Irish actor, author, comedian, commentator, and host who is better known by his stage name, Graham Norton. He is well-known for his work in the UK. His comedy chat shows The Graham Norton Show (2007–present) has won five BAFTA TV Awards, and he has won eight awards in total.</p><p>For example, he won the British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance three times for So Graham Norton (from 2000 to 2002). His talk show, which started out on BBC Two and then moved to other timeslots on BBC One, replaced Friday Night with Jonathan Ross in the prestigious late-Friday-evening slot on BBC One in 2010.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Graham Norton: Net Worth 2022</h2><p><strong>Graham Norton is an Irish comedian with a $40 million <a href=#>net worth</a></strong> <strong>as of 2022. </strong>On BBC One on Friday nights, he hosts a talk show called “The Graham Norton Show.” He works on several radio shows and has won the Best Entertainment Performance BAFTA TV Award five times. The British Academy Television Awards are also usually hosted by Norton.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Graham Norton: Early Life Details</h2><p>Graham William Walker was born in Dublin, Ireland, on April 4, 1963. He went to University College, Cork, but did not finish. He would get an honorary doctorate from the school at some point. He moved to London and worked as a waiter while attending the Central School of Speech and Drama. Graham chose the stage name Norton when he joined Equity because there was already a well-known actor with name Graham Walker.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Graham Norton: Personal Life Details</h2><p>After three years together, the openly gay entertainer and his partner, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Trevor Patterson</a>, broke up in 2013. In 2015, he broke up with his next partner, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Andrew Smith</a>. Norton has said that his ex-girlfriends often didn’t like being the public face of their relationship with him.</p><p>Norton was a young drama student in London in 1989 when he was attacked by a group of men on the street and stabbed. He lost half of his blood, and the attack almost killed him. He said that an older couple found him and called an ambulance for him, which saved his life.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by graham norton (@grahnort)</a></p></figure><p>Norton didn’t think it was a hate crime because he was walking alone when he was attacked.

Norton’s first show on the West End was “La Cage Aux Folles” at the Playhouse Theatre in January 2009.</p><p>Norton won the Guinness World Record on Comic Relief’s Big Chat in March 2013 for “Most Questions Asked on a TV Chat Show.” Norton publicly supported “Hacked Off” and its campaign for self-regulation of the UK press in 2014, saying that it would “protect the press from political interference and give vital protection to the vulnerable.”</p><p>From 2006 to 2018, Norton wrote a column for The Daily Telegraph newspaper called “Ask Norton.” In October 2010, his column “Ask Graham” was turned into a book with the same name. Norton wrote a book called “The Life and Loves of a He-Devil,” which came out in October 2014.

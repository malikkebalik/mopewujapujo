Salary, Earnings</h2><p>Book made the decision to let go of the celebrity and live a life free of it in the face of the <strong>potentially overwhelming amount</strong> of media attention that may have surrounded him.</p><p>Frank always remained to his work of sales and marketing instead of venturing into the fields that his ex-wife was so well-known for. He has been employed with<strong> Bob’s Discount Furniture</strong> for the past eight and a half years and is currently the Showroom Manager.</p><p>Book leads a contented life in Nanuet, New York, with his wife and children. Even if it’s difficult to estimate his net worth, it appears from his wife’s social media that the two lead quite an opulent life.</p><p>So it won’t mean anything to suggest that he has a net worth of somewhere in the six-figure level.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Chris Colfer, Who Is Openly Gay, Is Dating Someone</a></p><h2>Is Frank Bollok Married? Relationship</h2><p>Since 2018, Frank Bollok and Kristell Mapelli have been wed. Back in <strong>December 2018</strong>, the couple wed in a pretty understated ceremony.</p><p>After their nuptials, Bollok switched his relationship status on Facebook to <strong>“married”</strong> to mark the new chapter in his life. Frank gave the wedding date as <strong>December 21, 2018.</strong></p><figure id=attachment_1437582 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-1437582 style=width:650px class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding=async src alt="Frank Bollok " width=650 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Frank Bollok With His Son (Source Facebook)</strong></figure><p>The happy couple who are about to start their third year of marriage knew one other long before they got hitched. Frank first appeared on Kristen’s personal account on <strong>December 30, 2016,</strong> according to that account.</p><p>Therefore, it’s possible that the two began dating after that.</p><p>I guess it makes December the true “season of love”!</p><p>“Sun, ocean, beach, love, and family are all I need”</p><p>Just some straightforward love from Kristen to her Frank. The caption drew reference to a post she had published way back on <strong>August 15, 2020</strong>, in which she was rocking the beach-baby look.</p><p>The couple recently welcomed a baby boy into their lives, and it appears that Mapelli is savoring every second of motherhood as her Instagram account gradually transforms into that of her adorable kid.</p><p>Bollok, though, has already enjoyed some of the benefits of fatherhood before. Two daughters from his first marriage belong to him.</p><p>Aniko Bollok and Aspen Bollok, his two daughters from his marriage to Darcey Silva, are the father of three. Before deciding it was time to leave each other’s life, he and Silva were wed for a good eight years.</p><p>“I get along well and with respect with the father of my daughters. I will always be appreciative of my girls, Aniko and Aspen. We are fortunate to have them.”</p><p>told Darcey, a character on<strong> “90 Day Fiance,”</strong> to give love another shot. She continued by expressing her affection for her kids.</p><p>Speaking of the divorce itself, Darcey explained how the couple split up because they were looking for their soul mates. It appears from Darcey’s remark that they mutually decided to divorce.</p><p>Overall, even when couples divorce, what matters most is that they reach a compromise and put their differences aside for the benefit of their children, and Darcey and Frank have been wonderful at accomplishing this.</p><p>Bollok would undoubtedly receive a lot of media coverage, especially after getting married to a famous person. One cannot deny that some of the fame was passed on to Frank, despite the fact that their divorce was occasionally in the news.</p><p>And many people could assume that he has presumably used these resources to support a fairly comfortable lifestyle and a respectable net worth.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>According To Evan Roberts, Every Women Is A Hero For Surviving Childbirth</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity husband</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Manager</a></span> <a href=#><img src alt="Charlie Bigelow" title="Charlie Bigelow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Charlie Bigelow</a></h3>Charlie Bigelow- Biography Charlie Bigelow is the spouse of famed actress Elisa Donovan, who starred in the 1995 comedy film Clueless.

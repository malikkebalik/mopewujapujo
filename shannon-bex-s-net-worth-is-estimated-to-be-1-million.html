She is probably best known for her involvement in the music group Danity Kane, which was formed through the reality television series “Making the Band 3” by MTV. All her endeavors have contributed to her current net worth.</p><p>Shannon’s net worth is estimated to be over $1 million as of early-2016, mostly earned through a successful music career that began in 2002. Danity Kane released their first album in 2006, followed by “Welcome to the Dollhouse” in 2008. Her continued career is expected to further increase her wealth.</p><h3>Shannon Bex Net Worth $1 million</h3><p>Shannon started dancing at a young age and began ballet training. At the age of seven, she performed as part of the Oregon Ballet Theatre in “The Nutcracker”. She then diversified her dance skills by training in hip hop, jazz, modern, and lyrical dances. She was also involved in the choir, drama, and dance teams at Mountain View High School. After graduation, she worked as a Portland Trail Blazers cheerleader and later ventured into music by joining a cover band.</p><p>She remained with the Portland Trail Blazers cheerleading squad for five seasons and made an appearance on the series “Fame” in 2003, which led to an increase in her net worth. Following her participation in “Making the Band 3”, she became the oldest member of Danity Kane and the only married member during the group’s inception. The band released several albums and projects before disbanding in 2009. Afterward, Shannon formed a new band called Bex and later released a country solo album, initiating a fundraising campaign to support its independent distribution. She also reunited with some members of Danity Kane in 2013, contributing to her increasing net worth. However, the reunion was short-lived, and she later formed the dance/pop duo called Dumblonde with another former member, Aubrey O’Day.</p><p>Shannon has been married to Ron Basada since 2003, and her older brother, Marshall, owns a video production company.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Shannon Bex</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 22, 1980</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Gresham, Oregon, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 3 in (1.62 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Model, Dancer</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Mountain View High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Ron Basada</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Shannon Rae Bex</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/shannonbex</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/shannonbex</a></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/shannon_bex/</td></tr><tr><td>MySpace</td><td>https://myspace.com/bexshannon</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1422850/</td></tr><tr><td>Allmusic</td><td>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/shannon-mn0002092976</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Danity Kane, Dumblonde, Show Stopper, Damaged, Ride for You</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Making the Band 4, Fame</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Currently featured as a potential “band” member on MTV’s Making the Band 3 Season 2.
